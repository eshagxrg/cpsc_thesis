First-Year Seminar Program
The First-Year Seminar Program oﬀers a diverse array of courses open only to ﬁrst-
year students and designed with ﬁrst-year students in mind. Enrollment in seminars 
is limited to ﬁfteen or eighteen students, depending on the nature of the course. Most 
seminars meet twice each week and do not, unless otherwise noted, presume any prior 
experience in the ﬁeld.
Course descriptions for ﬁrst-year seminars can be found in Yale Course Search (under 
Yale College Attributes). The online listings contain course titles, descriptions, and 
prerequisites. Course syllabi are available on Canvas@Yale.
Students apply to ﬁrst-year seminars during registration. Students may only enroll 
in one ﬁrst-year seminar per term, with a maximum of two during their ﬁrst year at 
Yale College. Special permission is required for exceptions which must be approved by 
the Director of the First-Year Seminar Program. Auditing is not permitted in ﬁrst-year 
seminars.
