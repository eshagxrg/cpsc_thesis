Earth and Planetary Sciences
Directors of undergraduate studies: Celli Hull (pincelli.hull@yale.edu); earth.yale.edu
The Earth and Planetary Sciences (EPS) program, formerly Geology and Geophysics, 
prepares students for the application of scientiﬁc principles and methods to the 
understanding of the Earth system and other planets. Subjects range from the history 
of Earth and life to present-day environmental processes and climate change, the 
deep interiors of Earth and other planets, tectonic plates, oceans, atmospheres, 
climates, land surface, natural resources, and biota. The emphasis of the curriculum 
is on employing basic principles from the core sciences (physics, chemistry, and 
biology) to further an understanding of Earth’s past and present, and addressing 
issues relating to its future. Students gain a broad background in the natural sciences, 
and select a speciﬁc concentration to focus their work on planetary or environmental 
phenomena of particular interest. The four B.S. degree concentrations emphasize 
hands-on research experience in ﬁeldwork, in laboratories, or in theoretical analyses 
and computer modeling. While some graduates continue on to research, consulting, 
or industrial careers in Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences, the major’s 
broad scientiﬁc training prepares students for a wide variety of other paths, including 
medicine, law, public policy, and teaching. There is also a B.A. degree, which is most 
suitable for students who wish to study Earth and Planetary Sciences as a second 
major, complementing other majors in, for example, mathematics, economics, physics, 
biology, or engineering, and who do so in preparation for a career in law, business, 
government, or environmental ﬁelds.
Prerequisites
With permission of the director of undergraduate studies (DUS), acceleration credits 
awarded at matriculation for high scores on national or international examinations 
(such as Advanced Placement subject tests) may be used to satisfy prerequisites, 
even if the student does not choose to accelerate. Higher-level courses may, with the 
permission of the DUS, be substituted for prerequisites and for speciﬁc required 
courses. For prerequisites speciﬁc for each concentration, see Requirements of the 
Major.
Requirements of the Major
B.A. degree program/uni2002The B.A. degree in Earth and Planetary Sciences requires fewer 
upper-level courses than the B.S. degree. It may be more appropriate for students who 
plan to fulﬁll the requirements of two majors, who study Earth and Planetary Sciences 
in preparation for a career in law, business, government, or environmental ﬁelds, 
or who decide to pursue a science major only after the ﬁrst year. The prerequisites 
include mathematics (MATH 1150 ), biology (BIOL 1010  and BIOL 1020  or EPS 2550), 
or physics (PHYS 1700, 1710; or PHYS 1800, 1810; or PHYS 2000, 2010), and a 
lecture course in chemistry. The major requirements consist of at least nine term 
courses for at least nine credits, beyond the prerequisites. These include two courses 
in EPS numbered 1000–1400, with any accompanying laboratories; courses in natural 
resources (EPS 2740 or EPS 2750 and geochemical processes (EPS 2200 or EPS 2320 or
EPS 2610 or EPS 3100); and ﬁve additional courses at the 2000 level or higher in Earth 
and Planetary Sciences or related ﬁelds, approved by the DUS and including either 240            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
the senior essay or the senior thesis. Course selections can be guided by any of the B.S. 
concentrations described above.
B.S. degree program/uni2002Majors in the B.S. program in Earth and Planetary Sciences 
choose from four concentrations: Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate; Environmental 
and Energy Geoscience; Paleontology and Geobiology; and Solid Earth Science. The 
concentrations are suggested pathways to professional careers and major areas of 
research in earth and planetary sciences. Students may change concentrations during 
their course of study with guidance from the DUS.
1.The Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate concentration provides a comprehensive 
understanding of the atmosphere-ocean-climate system. Topics range from 
past climate changes, including the ice ages, to present-day atmospheric and 
ocean circulation, to weather phenomena, to global warming projections. The 
prerequisites are CHEM 1650  or CHEM 1670 ; PHYS 1800, 1810 and PHYS 2050L,
2060L; ENAS 1300 or equivalent; and mathematics through diﬀerential equations 
(MATH 1200  or ENAS 1510, and ENAS 1940). The major requirements consist 
of at least eleven term courses, for at least eleven course credits, beyond the 
prerequisites, including either the senior essay or the senior thesis. To begin 
study of Earth processes, majors take an introductory course in EPS, selected 
from EPS 1000; EPS 1010; EPS 1100 with 1110L; or EPS 1250 with 1260L. EPS 1000
and 1010 do not require an accompanying lab. Five core courses, totaling ﬁve course 
credits, introduce students to Earth’s climate system (EPS 1400), meteorology 
(EPS 3220), physical oceanography (EPS 3350), ﬂuid mechanics ( MENG 3422 ), 
and statistics or linear algebra (S&DS 2300  or 2380 or MATH 2220 ). Other higher-
level courses in EPS can be substituted with the permission of the DUS. Four 
electives are chosen from topics in the environment and in processes that govern 
the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface, physics, and statistics. A list of suggested 
electives is available from the oﬃce of the DUS or on the department website. At 
least one elective must be from EPS.
2.The Environmental and Energy Geoscience concentration provides a scientiﬁc 
understanding of the natural and anthropogenic processes that shape the Earth-
atmosphere-biosphere system, including energy and material ﬂows among its 
components. It emphasizes comparative studies of past and current Earth processes 
to inform models of humankind’s role within the environment’s future. The 
prerequisites are broad and ﬂexible and include CHEM 1650  or CHEM 1670
and mathematics through multivariate calculus (MATH 1200  or ENAS 1510). 
Depending on their area of focus, students may choose a prerequisite in physics 
(PHYS 1700, 1710; or PHYS 1800, 1810; or PHYS 2000, 2010), or they may 
choose cellular biology (BIOL 1010  and 1020, or MCDB 120 ) and evolutionary 
biology (BIOL 1030  and 1040 or EPS 1250 and 1260L). The major requirements 
consist of at least eleven term courses, for at least eleven course credits, beyond the 
prerequisites, including either the senior essay or the senior thesis. To begin study 
of the Earth system, majors take two introductory courses in EPS, selected from
EPS 1000; EPS 1010; EPS 1100 with 1110L; EPS 1250 with 1260L; or EPS 1400. 
Four core courses are chosen from Earth's surface processes (EPS 2320), the 
microbiology of surface and near-surface environments (EPS 2550), fossil fuels 
and energy transitions (EPS 2740), renewable energies (EPS 2750), geochemical 
principles ( EPS 3100), geology (EPS 2100 or EPS 2200 or EPS 3120), meteorology Earth and Planetary Sciences         241
(EPS 3220), and satellite-based image analysis (EPS 3620). Other higher-level 
courses in EPS can be substituted with the permission of the DUS. Four electives 
chosen from Earth & Planetary Sciences, Environmental Studies, Ecology and 
Evolutionary Biology, Engineering, or related ﬁelds provide a broad approach to 
scientiﬁc study of the environment. A list of suggested electives is available from the 
oﬃce of the DUS or on the department website. Electives may be chosen from the 
core courses, and at least two must be from EPS.
3.The Paleontology and Geobiology concentration focuses on the fossil record of 
life and evolution, geochemical imprints of life, and interactions between life and 
Earth. Topics range from morphology, function, relationships, and biogeography of 
the fossils themselves, through the contexts of fossil ﬁnds in terms of stratigraphy, 
sediment geochemistry, paleoecology, paleoclimate, and geomorphology, to 
analysis of the larger causes of paleontological, geobiological, and evolutionary 
patterns. Integrative approaches are emphasized that link fossil evidence with the 
physical and chemical evolution of Earth. The prerequisites are college-level biology 
(BIOL 1010 –1040), or CHEM 1650  or CHEM 1670 , and mathematics through 
multivariate calculus (MATH 1200  or ENAS 1510). The major requirements consist 
of at least twelve term courses, for at least eleven and a half course credits, beyond 
the prerequisites, including either the senior essay or the senior thesis. Students 
take one of EPS 1000; EPS 1010; or EPS 1100 with 1110L, to gain geological and 
environmental context, and they also take EPS 1250 and 1260L as an introduction 
to the fossil record and evolution. Four core courses are chosen from topics in four 
of the following areas: in sedimentary processes (EPS 2320 or EPS 3550), the study 
of evolution (EEB 2225), vertebrates and vertebrate paleontology (EPS 2700 or
EPS 3250 or EPS 3750), invertebrate paleontology (EPS 3130), paleoecology 
(EPS 3450), microbiology in past and present environments (EPS 2550), Earth's 
carbon cycle and climate (EPS 3100 or 4020), and statistical data analysis as applied 
to the life sciences. Other higher-level courses in EPS can be substituted with the 
permission of the DUS. Four electives selected from Earth and Planetary Sciences,
Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental 
Biology, and related ﬁelds oﬀer students ﬂexibility in pursuing their speciﬁc 
interests. A list of suggested electives is available from the oﬃce of the DUS or on 
the department website. At least four of the twelve term courses should be upper 
level (2000 or above) paleontology courses and at least one elective must be from 
EPS.
4.The Solid Earth Science concentration emphasizes an integrated geological, 
geochemical, and geophysical approach to the study of processes operating within 
Earth and their manifestations on the surface. It includes the structure, dynamics, 
and kinetics of Earth's interior and their impacts on our environment both in the 
long term (e.g., the evolution of the land surface) and in the short term (e.g., the 
causes of natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions). 
Students acquire a fundamental understanding of the solid Earth system, both as 
it exists today and as it has evolved over geologic timescales. The prerequisites are
CHEM 1650  or CHEM 1670 , physics (PHYS 1700, 1710; or PHYS 1800, 1810; or
PHYS 2000, 2010), and mathematics through multivariate calculus (MATH 1200
or ENAS 1510). The major requirements consist of at least eleven courses, for at 
least eleven course credits, beyond the prerequisites, including either the senior 
essay or the senior thesis. To begin study of the Earth system, majors take two 242            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
introductory courses in EPS, selected from EPS 1000; EPS 1010; EPS 1100 with
1110L; EPS 1250 with 1260L; or EPS 1400. The core of the concentration consists 
of four courses chosen from topics in mountain building and global tectonics 
(EPS 2100 or EPS 2120 or EPS 3500), rocks and minerals (EPS 2200), sedimentary 
rocks and processes (EPS 2320), isotope geochemistry (EPS 3100), and structural 
geology (EPS 3120). Other higher-level courses in EPS can be substituted with the 
permission of the DUS. Students also select four electives in geology, geochemistry, 
geophysics, or related topics. A list of suggested electives is available from the 
oﬃce of the DUS or on the department website. Electives may be chosen from core 
courses, and at least two must be from EPS.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied to the prerequisites or 
the requirements of the major.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement 
Seniors in both degree programs must prepare either a senior essay based on one 
term of library, laboratory, or ﬁeld research (EPS 4920) or, with the consent of the 
faculty, a two-term senior thesis (EPS 4900 , EPS 4910), which involves innovative 
ﬁeld, laboratory, or theoretical research. Students electing to do a senior thesis must 
ﬁrst select a topic and obtain the consent of a faculty member to act as an adviser. They 
must then petition the faculty through the DUS for approval of the thesis proposal. 
The petition should be submitted by the start of the senior year. If the two-term senior 
thesis is elected, EPS 4910 may count as an elective toward the major. A copy of each 
senior thesis or senior essay is made available on the department website.
Advising
Qualiﬁed juniors and seniors are encouraged to enroll in graduate courses, with 
permission of the instructor, the DUS, and the director of graduate studies. 
Descriptions of graduate courses are available at the oﬃce of the DUS.
Practical experience/uni2002In addition to prerequisites and required courses in Earth and 
Planetary Sciences, candidates for the B.A. and B.S. degrees are strongly encouraged 
to gain practical experience. This can be done in two ways: (1) by attending a summer 
ﬁeld course at another academic institution, or (2) by participating in summer research 
opportunities oﬀered by the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, by other 
academic institutions, or by certain government agencies and private industries.
