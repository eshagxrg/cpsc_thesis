Students in the Art major develop a critical and practical understanding of the visual 
arts and design through a studio-based curriculum that organically blends practice 
with critical thinking and art historical precedents; apply fundamentals of visual art 
across a variety of mediums and disciplines; relate the practice of making art and 
design to culture and the study areas of art history and theory; and learn to embody 
the knowledge and practice of at least one artistic discipline through active search 
and research. Students may concentrate on a medium such as painting/printmaking, 
sculpture, graphic design, photography, or ﬁlmmaking, and interdisciplinary study is 
supported. Art majors learn to place their own work in the context of an inclusive group 
of contemporary art worlds and national and global cultures. This study is a crucial 
element in a liberal arts curriculum both for future arts practitioners and for those 
ultimately studying and working in other ﬁelds. A key element of the creative learning 
process is the critique, which is implemented via both group settings and one-on-one 
studio visits with faculty and visiting critics. Through rigorous practice and regular 
feedback, a student gains insight into one's own critical voice. Art majors have access to 
the graduate program by attending regular lectures, critiques, events, and exhibitions 
that represent a diverse set of art practitioners who regularly visit the School of Art.
Courses for Nonmajors and Majors
Courses in Art are open to all undergraduate students, but are registered by permission 
of instructor only due to limited class size. In cases where student demand for entry 
into a course is greater than can be accommodated, priority is given to School of 
Art students and declared Art and Computing and the Arts majors. The director of 
undergraduate studies (DUS) and members of the Art faculty typically hold counseling 
meetings during the registration period. See the Art department website listed above 
for more information. Students seeking advice about course selection or the program 
in Art should attend these advising sessions. Others wishing to elect an Art course 
should visit the course’s Canvas site for details, and request instructor permission 
during the registration period to apply for these limited-enrollment classes. Many 
studio art courses require the purchase of a limited number of supplies in addition 
to the materials provided in the class. All Art majors are required to register with the 
DUS at the beginning of each term to be enrolled or to continue in the major, as well as 
participate in the sophomore review in the fourth term.
Prerequisites
The prerequisites for acceptance into the major are the sophomore review, which is 
an intensive advising session and evaluation of work from studio courses taken at the 
Yale School of Art, and ﬁve introductory courses (courses numbered 0001–1999). Four 
of the introductory courses must have been completed at the time of the sophomore 
review. Visual Thinking (ART 1111) and Basic Drawing (ART 1514) are mandatory, and 
may not be waived. At the time of the review, the student should be enrolled in the ﬁfth Art         177
1000-level prerequisite course. In exceptional cases, arrangements for a special review 
during the junior year may be made with the DUS.
Requirements of the Major
The Art major requires fourteen courses, including the following: (1) ﬁve prerequisite 
courses at the Introductory level numbered 0001–1999 (including ART 1111 and
ART 1514); (2) four courses at the 2000-level or above; (3) the Junior Seminar 
(ART 3995); (4) the two-term senior project (ART 4995 and ART 4996); and (5) 
two courses in the history of art, or DUS-approved equivalent. A student who has 
completed ﬁve courses numbered 0001–1999 may count a sixth such course towards 
the 2000-level course requirement. Program guidelines and speciﬁc requirements for 
the various areas of concentration are described below.
Areas of concentration Each Art major selects an area of concentration from ﬁve 
possible choices: (1) graphic design, (2) painting/printmaking, (3) photography, 
(4) sculpture, and (5) ﬁlmmaking. Suggested courses for the graphic design 
concentration are: ART 1732, 2764, 2765, 2766 or 3768; ART 3769 or 3770; 
and ART 4768 or 4769. Speciﬁc courses recommended for the painting/printmaking 
concentration are ART 1516, 1530, 3531 or 3532; ART 2524, 2545 or 3556; and ART 4514,
4532, 4533 or 4557. Students in the photography concentration should take ART 1836 and/
or 1838; ART 2837 and/or 2839; ART 3837 or 3838; ART 3879 and 4801. The sculpture 
concentration recommends 2 of the following: ART 1610, 1620, 1621, 1621 or 1623; and 
3 of the following: ART 2610, 3646, 3648, ART 3771 or 4646. Required courses for the
ﬁlmmaking concentration are ART 1942, 3941, 3942, and ART 4942 or 4943. Students in 
the ﬁlmmaking concentration may substitute two non-production courses in Film and 
Media Studies for the history of art requirement, and the same for other concentrations 
only with permission of the DUS. Students wishing to work interdisciplinarily should 
consult with the DUS.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No more than one course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward 
the requirements of the major.
Outside credit/uni2002Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
The senior requirement consists of a two-term senior project, ART 4995 and
ART 4996.
Unique to the Major
Summer fellowship Art majors are eligible to apply for the Ellen Battell Stoeckel 
Fellowship for study at the Yale University Summer School of Music and Art in 
Norfolk, Connecticut. Applicants for the program must be oﬃcially classiﬁed as junior 
Art majors and be returning to Yale for two terms of their senior year. The program 
awards up to three course credits for work successfully completed. These credits may be 
used toward the requirements of the Art major at the discretion of the DUS.
Repeated and outside courses Some Art courses may be repeated for credit, with 
permission of both the instructor and the DUS. Course credits in studio art earned at 
other institutions may, in some cases, be applied toward the requirements of the major, 178            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
but not to replace the two prerequisites, and is done solely at the discretion of the DUS 
and subject to a faculty review process.
