Computer Science and Mathematics is an interdepartmental major for students who 
are interested in computational mathematics, the use of computers in mathematics, 
mathematical aspects of algorithm design and analysis, and theoretical foundations of 
computing.
Requirements of the Major
See Links to the attributes indicating courses approved for the Computer Science and 
Math major requirements.
The major requires fourteen term courses as well as a senior project. Six of the 
fourteen courses must be in computer science: CPSC 2010 ; CPSC 2230 ; CPSC 3230 ; 
and CPSC 3650  or 3660; one advanced course with signiﬁcant mathematical 
content; and one additional advanced course other than CPSC 4900 . Only one 
of CPSC 3650  and 3660 may be taken for major credit. The remaining eight courses 
must be in mathematics: MATH 1200 , either MATH 2250  or 2260, MATH 2440 , and 
ﬁve additional term courses numbered 2250-4690.
With prior written permission from the Mathematics DUS, students who completed 
multivariable calculus during high school may substitute a higher level mathematics 
course in the same area for MATH 1200 .
A course must be listed with a MATH number to count toward the mathematics 
requirements and must be listed with a CPSC number to count toward the computer 
science requirements—substitutions from other departments are not allowed. Graduate 
mathematics courses level 5000-5999 may be counted as electives; graduate 
mathematics courses level 6000 or above may not be counted.
Credit/D/Fail No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of the major.
Outside credit Courses taken after matriculation at Yale at another institution or during 
an approved summer or term-time study abroad program may count toward the major 
requirements with DUS approval.
Senior Requirement
The senior requirement is a project or an essay on a topic acceptable to both 
departments. Students typically enroll in CPSC 4900  or MATH 4750 . Permission 
must be obtained in writing from the director of undergraduate studies (DUS) of both 
departments before embarking on the project or the essay.
Advising
The entire program of each student majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics 
must be approved by the DUS in each department.228            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
