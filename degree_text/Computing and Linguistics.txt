Computing and Linguistics
Director of undergraduate studies: Simon Charlow (simon.charlow@yale.edu) 
(Linguistics); Computing and Linguistics website
The Computing and Linguistics major provides multidisciplinary training in the 
computational study of human language, the development of systems for natural 
language processing, and the automated analysis of textual data in applications in 
the humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Students learn the foundational tools 
and methods that underlie this work, including areas of computer science, statistics 
and data science, and linguistics, and apply them to some empirical domain, through 
coursework and an independent research project in the senior year.
The B.A. in Computing and Linguistics exposes students to the fundamental ideas and 
foundational techniques of the ﬁeld, while the B.S. provides more extensive training 
and engagement in research, preparing students for graduate work in the area.
prerequisites
There are three prerequisites for this major and they fall in three areas of study: (1)
statistics, satisﬁed through S&DS 1000 , or 1230, or 2200, or comparable background 
in statistics (e.g., through a score of 5 on the AP Statistics exam) as approved by the 
director of undergraduate studies (DUS); (2) programming, satisﬁed through an 
appropriate introductory programming course or comparable experience as approved 
by the DUS; and (3) linguistics, satisﬁed through one 1000-level Linguistics course. It 
is also advisable that students have some background in single-variable calculus, before 
beginning this major. 
Requirements of the Major
See Link to the YC CPLI Elective in CP & Ling  attribute indicating courses approved for 
the major requirements.
B.A. degree program/uni2002The B.A. degree program requires 11 term credits beyond the 
prerequisites and not including the senior requirement. Core courses, as listed below, 
are required from the following categories: 2 math core courses; 1 statistics core course 
(S&DS 2380 ); 2 linguistics core courses; 2 computation core courses; 3 advanced 
courses; 1 elective, and 1 senior requirement course.
B.S. degree program/uni2002The B.S. degree program requires 14 term credits beyond 
the prerequisites and not including the senior requirement. Core courses, as listed 
below, are required from the following categories: 2 math core courses; 2 statistics 
core courses; 3 linguistics core courses; 2 computation core courses; 3 advanced courses; 
2 electives, and 2 senior requirement courses.
Math core courses/uni2002Both B.A. and B.S. degree students must take one course in proof-
based discrete mathematics (one of MATH 2440 , LING 2249 , or CPSC 2020 ) and one 
course in linear algebra (either MATH 2220  or MATH 2250 ).
Statistics core courses/uni2002These provide foundations in probability and statistical 
theory. B.A. degree students satisfy this requirement by taking S&DS 2380 ; B.S. degree 
students choose between two options (1) one of S&DS 2400  or S&DS 2410 , together 232            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
with S&DS 2420 ; (2) S&DS 2380  and either S&DS 2300  or any S&DS course numbered 
2420 or above.
Linguistics core courses/uni2002These courses, LING 2320 , 2530, and 2630, expose students 
to the nature of linguistic structure and its variability across languages, at the level of 
sound (phonology), form (syntax) and meaning (semantics). B.A. degree students 
must take 2 out of these 3 courses, while B.S. degree students must take all 3.
Computation core courses Computational studies of language rest crucially on the 
foundations of computer science and programming. To this end, both B.A. and B.S. 
degree students must take CPSC 2010  and 2230.
Advanced courses /uni2002Both B.A. and B.S. degree students must take 1 advanced course 
in linguistic structure, either LING 3350 , 3540, or 3640; 1 course in natural language 
processing, either CPSC 4770  or LING 2270 ; and 1 course in machine learning, 
either S&DS 2650 , 3650, or CPSC 3810 .
Electives Elective courses may be used to explore the application of the techniques of 
computational linguistics across a range of disciplines or to deepen expertise in these 
techniques. Courses that are pre-approved to satisfy the elective requirement are listed 
on the Computing and Linguistics major website, but other relevant courses may satisfy 
this requirement with DUS approval. B.A. degree students take 1 elective course; B.S. 
degree students take 2 electives. /uni2003
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of the major (other than as prerequisites).
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
All Computing and Linguistics majors enroll in the capstone seminar CSLI 4900 in 
the fall of the senior year. This seminar includes discussion of student research, as well 
as presentations by researchers in the ﬁeld from both inside and outside of Yale. B.A. 
degree students complete a senior project as part of CSLI 4900, working either on an 
independent project supervised by a Yale faculty member with relevant expertise or as 
part of a group eﬀort of capstone seminar participants. B.S. degree students enroll in 
the capstone seminar in the fall and continue work on their senior project in the spring. 
The senior project of B.S. degree students must involve independent research.
Advising
Students interested in the Computing and Linguistics major are encouraged to consult 
with the DUS. Further information about the major and answers to FAQs are available 
on the Computing and Linguistics website. The entire selection of courses by students 
in the major must be approved by the DUS.
