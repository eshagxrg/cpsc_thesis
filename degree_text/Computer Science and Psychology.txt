Computer Science and Psychology

Computer Science and Psychology is an interdepartmental major designed for students 
interested in integrating work in these two ﬁelds. Each area provides tools and theories 
that can be applied to problems in the other. Examples of this interaction include 
cognitive science, artiﬁcial intelligence, and biological perception.
Prerequisite
The prerequisite for the major is PSYC 1100, from which students who have scored 5 
on the Advanced Placement test in Psychology are exempt. Beyond the prerequisite, the 
major requires fourteen term courses as well as a senior project.
Requirements of the Major
Students are held to the requirements that were in place when they declared 
their major. However, with approval from the Psychology DUS, the following 
requirements (speciﬁcally the elimination of PSYC 2100 as a requirement), updated for 
the academic year 2025-2026, may be fulﬁlled by students who declared the major in a 
prior term./uni2002
See Links to attributes indicating courses approved for Psychology major requirements.
Eight of the fourteen required courses must be in computer science: CPSC 2010 ,
2020, 2230, 3230, and CPSC 3650  or 3660, and three advanced computer 
science courses in artiﬁcial intelligence (examples of such courses are those 
in the range CPSC 4700 –CPSC 4770 , CPSC 4520 , 4530, CPSC 4810 –4890).
CPSC 2800  and 4900 may not be counted as one of these courses. MATH 2440  may 
substitute for CPSC 2020 . Only one of CPSC 3650  and 3660 may be taken for major 
credit.
The remaining six courses for the psychology requirement include one course in 
statistics, either S&DS 1000  or S&DS 2300 , and at least one course in research methods 
from PSYC 2100–2990; at least two psychology courses from the social science point 
of view; and at least two courses from the natural science point of view. At least one of 
the two psychology courses from both the social science point of view and the natural 
science point of view must be designated as Core in the course listings. Refer to the
Psychology program overview for a listing of courses that fulﬁll the social science and 
natural science requirements and a description of courses designated as Core.
With the permission of both directors of undergraduate studies (DUSs), a course in 
cognitive psychology or cognitive science that is highly relevant to the major and that 
is not counted as one of the six courses in psychology may substitute for one of the 
courses in artiﬁcial intelligence.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course in Computer Science taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied 
toward the requirements of the major; no more than one course in psychology taken 
Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the major requirements. No 200-level course in 
psychology taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the major requirements.230            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement 
Students must take either CPSC 4900  or PSYC 4990, and the project must be approved 
by the DUS in each department.
Advising
The entire program of each student majoring in computer science and psychology must 
be approved by the DUS in each department.
