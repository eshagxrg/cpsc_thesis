Economics is much broader than the study of recessions and inﬂation or stocks and 
bonds. Economists study decision making and incentives, such as how taxes create 
incentives for labor market and savings behavior. Many current public policy debates 
concern questions of economics, including causes and consequences of inequality and 
gender and racial wage gaps; how to address poverty; the impact of immigration and 
trade on the well-being of a country’s citizens; the cause of the Great Recession; and 
how to predict future downturns.
At Yale, economics is regarded and taught as part of a liberal arts education, not as a 
preparation for any particular vocation. It can, however, provide a good background 
for several professions. The economics major strengthens critical reasoning skills and 
gives students experience analyzing data, skills that will serve students well on the 
job market both inside and outside academia. Recent majors have pursued careers in 
business, government, and nonproﬁts. Others have entered law, medical, or business 
school, or have gone on to graduate work in economics, often after working in related 
ﬁelds for two or three years. 
requirements of the major
See Links to the attributes indicating courses approved for the Economics 
major requirements.
There are no prerequisites for the major. Twelve credits are necessary to complete the 
major (11 Economics courses and 1 Mathematics course). The required distribution of 
courses is as follows:
Math requirement This can be fulﬁlled by MATH 1100 /1110, 1120, 1150, 1160,
ENAS 1510, or preferably MATH 1180  or 1200. MATH 1180  and 1200 are recommended 
because they emphasize economics applications. Any Math course numbered 2000 or 
higher can also be used to fulﬁll the math requirement. Note that MATH 1100  and 1110
together count as one course toward the economics major.
Introductory microeconomics/uni2002ECON 1108 or ECON 1110 or ECON 1115. This 
requirement can be skipped or taken Cr/D/F based on pre-college testing or other 
circumstances, but an extra elective course is required in this case.
Introductory macroeconomics/uni2002ECON 1111 or ECON 1116. This requirement can be 
skipped or taken Cr/D/F based on pre-college testing or other circumstances, but an 
extra elective course is required in this case.
Intermediate microeconomics/uni2002ECON 2121 or ECON 2125
Intermediate macroeconomics/uni2002ECON 2122 or ECON 2126
Econometrics/uni2002ECON 1117 or ECON 2123 or ECON 2136Economics         257
Four electives/uni2002 Any Economics course numbered 1159 or above can count as an elective, 
if not already applied towards the core requirements. With DUS approval, a non-
Economics course that is related to economics can be used to fulﬁll one of the electives.
Senior requirement  Two courses numbered ECON 4400–4491 (at least one taken in 
senior year) are required.
Senior essay/uni2002Writing a senior essay is optional, but it is necessary to earn distinction in 
the major.
Distinction in the major  To earn Distinction, a student must write a senior thesis 
earning a grade of A- or better and receive A- or better in three-quarters of the courses 
that are counted toward the major (not including introductory microeconomics, 
introductory macroeconomics, the math requirement or courses taken outside of Yale). 
Economics courses taken beyond the requirements of the major are counted toward the 
Distinction calculation.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Cr/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements of 
the major.
Outside credit  Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Note Residential College Seminars and First Year Seminars may not be counted toward 
the requirements of the major.
Introductory Courses
Many Yale students, regardless of what major they later choose, take introductory 
courses in economics. The department oﬀ ers introductory courses in microeconomics, 
macroeconomics, and econometrics. Microeconomics examines how individuals, 
ﬁrms, markets, and governments allocate scarce resources; macroeconomics studies 
growth, unemployment, inﬂation, and international economics; econometrics teaches 
students statistical fundamentals and how to analyze data to answer economic 
questions. Students should take introductory microeconomics before taking either 
introductory macroeconomics or introductory econometrics.
ECON 1115 is concerned with microeconomics and includes such topics as markets, 
prices, production, distribution, and the allocation of resources. ECON 1116 covers 
such macroeconomic issues as unemployment, inﬂation, growth, and international 
economics. ECON 1117 introduces students to basic aspects of working with data 
to answer economic questions, as well as to the fundamentals of statistical analysis.  
ECON 1116 and 1117 have microeconomics as a prerequisite. ECON 1115, 1116, and 1117 
are lecture courses with accompanying discussion sections.
ECON 1110 and 1111 are smaller, slightly more discussion-oriented versions of 
introductory microeconomics and macroeconomics. Those with little or no experience 
in calculus may be better served by ECON 1108, which covers microeconomics with 
greater discussion of quantitative methods and examples. ECON 1108, 1110, and 1115 are 
similar in substance; ECON 1111 and 1116 are similar in substance as well.
The department recommends that students interested in majoring in Economics take 
at least two introductory economics courses in the ﬁrst year. To make the introductory 258            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
courses available to all ﬁrst-year students and to students majoring in other subjects, 
the introductory courses do not have a mathematics requirement.
In the summer before they enter, all ﬁrst-year students receive, through the University’s 
electronic bulletin board, a personalized recommendation for a ﬁrst course in 
economics, based on application data and AP (or equivalent) exam scores. In general, 
students who receive a score of 5 on the Microeconomics or Macroeconomics AP exam  
and a score of 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam are recommended to place out of the 
corresponding introductory course and instead enroll in intermediate-level courses 
(ECON 2121 or 2125 for microeconomics, ECON 2122 or 2126 for macroeconomics).
Mathematics courses
Students are advised to meet the mathematics requirement for the major during 
their ﬁrst year. To fulﬁll the requirement, the department recommends that majors 
take MATH 1180 or MATH 1200, or a higher-level course. Also acceptable, but less 
preferred, are MATH 1120, 1150, 1160, ENAS 1510, or MATH 1100 and 1110. Students 
who intend to pursue a graduate degree in economics should take additional math 
courses, including linear algebra (MATH 2220) or even better, a proof-based course 
(MATH 2250 or 2260) and a real analysis course (MATH 2550 or 2560).
econometrics courses
Students are encouraged to take two econometrics courses, especially if they are 
interested in a research experience on or oﬀ campus. Two econometrics courses are 
required to write a senior essay (see below). The analysis of economic data has become 
central to the work of economists, and the ability to analyze large data sets is a skill that 
will serve students in the job market both inside and outside of academia. A natural 
path is for students to take ECON 1117 followed by 2123. Students with a stronger 
mathematics background, who prefer a more theoretical treatment of the material or 
who plan to pursue a graduate degree in economics, are encouraged to take ECON 2135 
or S&DS 2410 and S&DS 2420, followed by ECON 2136. Prospective majors planning 
to take a two-term econometric sequence are urged to start the sequence by the fall of 
sophomore year.
Note  S&DS 2410 and 2420 together count as one course toward the economics major. 
Further note that neither ECON 2135 nor S&DS 2410 and 2420 fulﬁll the major's 
requirement of one econometrics course as they are courses in probability and statistics 
that are prerequisites for ECON 2136, a course in econometrics. However, either  
ECON 1117 or ECON 2123 fulﬁlls the econometrics requirement.
Intermediate microeconomics and macroeconomics courses
Two course options are available in both microeconomics and macroeconomics. The 
standard intermediate courses are ECON 2121 and 2122. Students with a stronger 
mathematics background who are interested in a more theoretical treatment of the 
material are encouraged to take ECON 2125 and 2126 instead. The intermediate courses 
need not be taken in sequence: in particular, ECON 2125 is not required for 2126; 
ECON 2121 is not required for 2122.
Electives 
The department o ﬀers a wide selection of courses in a variety of ﬁelds that can be 
used as electives. These courses are numbered ECON 1159 and above. Some of these Economics         259
courses have no prerequisites or only introductory microeconomics as a prerequisite. 
Others apply intermediate-level theory or econometrics to economic problems and 
institutions, and for this reason list one or more of the theory or econometrics courses 
as prerequisites. With DUS approval, a Yale non-Economics course that is related to 
economics can be used to fulﬁll one of the electives. See the Economics department 
website for more details.
Senior requirement 
Two courses numbered ECON 4400–4491 (at least one taken in senior year) are 
required.
Advanced lecture courses, generally numbered ECON 4440–4449, are limited-
enrollment courses that cover relatively advanced material in more depth than regular 
ﬁeld courses. While these courses vary in approach, they share features of other 
Economics courses: like ﬁeld courses, they devote some time to traditional lecturing, 
and like seminars, they emphasize class interaction, the writing of papers, and the 
reading of journal articles. Advanced lecture courses may be applied toward the senior 
requirement.
Senior seminars are generally numbered ECON 4450–4490. Although there is 
diversity in approaches in the various seminars, all have in common an emphasis on 
class interaction, the writing of papers, and the reading of journal articles. Seminars 
represent an opportunity for students to apply and extend the economics they have 
learned through their earlier coursework.
Enrollment in seminars and advanced lecture courses is limited. Senior Economics 
majors who have not yet completed the senior requirement for the major are given 
priority for these courses and may enter preference selection before the registration 
period for these courses; see the department website for instructions. Other majors and 
non-majors may enroll in Economics seminars and advanced lecture courses as space 
permits, but they may not enter preference selection.
Senior Essay
Students have the option to write a Senior Essay; it is not required. There are three 
types of senior essays: (1) students may write a one-term essay in the fall of the senior 
year as an independent project on a topic of their own design under the close and 
regular supervision of a faculty adviser; (2) students may write a two-term essay in 
their ﬁnal two terms of the senior year as an independent project on a topic of their 
own design under the close and regular supervision of a faculty adviser; (3) students 
may write a two-term essay in consecutive terms, beginning in an advanced course 
(numbered 4400–4490), and completed in the ﬁnal term of the senior year as an 
independent project under supervision of a faculty adviser. Under this ﬁnal option, the 
instructor of the advanced course taken in the fall term typically serves as the faculty 
adviser for the full academic year.
Students are required to complete a second semester of econometrics either before 
or during the ﬁrst semester of senior year. Please refer to the Economics department 
website for information on the courses that qualify.260            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
ADVISING
The Economics department has faculty advisers for each residential college. Students 
considering a major in economics as well as declared economics majors should consult 
with an economics adviser for their college during course enrollment. Questions 
concerning the major may also be directed to the department peer mentors. A list of 
peer mentors can be found on the department website.
Outside credit 
Students who take courses outside of Yale may petition the DUS to count some of them 
toward the requirements of the major. Students should consult with the DUS before 
taking such courses. Courses taken outside of Yale may not be counted toward the 
major requirements in intermediate microeconomics, intermediate macroeconomics, 
econometrics, mathematics, or the senior requirement. There are also restrictions on 
the number of credits that can be transferred: see the department website section on 
transferring credits.
Graduate courses/uni2002
Well-qualiﬁed students who have acquired the requisite background in undergraduate 
courses may be admitted to graduate courses and seminars. Descriptions of courses are 
available on the department website.
Students who are planning graduate work in economics should take additional 
mathematics courses beyond the one-term course required for the major. Many 
graduate programs in economics require courses in multivariate calculus, linear algebra, 
and real analysis. Please see the department website on Ph.D. program preparation. 
Students are urged to discuss their plans for graduate work with the DUS as early in 
their college careers as possible.
