Architecture
Director of undergraduate studies: Michael Schlabs (michael.schlabs@yale.edu), 
RDH, 180 York St.; architecture.yale.edu
Architecture is a humanistic endeavor. The purpose of the undergraduate major is 
to include the study of architecture within a comprehensive liberal arts education, 
drawing from the broader academic and professional environment of the Yale School of 
Architecture. The curriculum includes work in design; in history, theory, and criticism 
of architecture; and in urbanism, and leads to a bachelor of arts degree with a major in 
Architecture. As a liberal arts major in Yale College, it is not an accredited professional 
degree program. For accredited professional degree programs, refer to the requirements 
of the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).
Introductory Courses for Nonmajors and Majors
Introductory courses are ARCH 1001, 2000, and 2600. They are open to all Yale 
College students and are required for those interested in the Architecture major prior 
to submitting a Declaration of Intent to Major. Interested students may also consider 
courses such as ARCH 1300, 1600, 2001, 2003, 2103, or 2601.
Prerequisites
Three courses are prerequisite for all concentrations: ARCH 1001; 2000; and one of the 
following: ARCH 2103, 2600, or 2601.
Requirements of the Major     
Students majoring in Architecture are required to take ﬁfteen course credits, including 
prerequisites and the senior requirement. Majors are expected to take the three 
prerequisites by the end of their sophomore year and to complete a core of four 
courses, for ﬁve course credits, by the end of their junior year. They must also base 
their studies in one of two areas of concentration: the Design concentration or the 
History, Theory, Criticism of Architecture, and Urbanism concentration. Majors are 
also required to complete three orientation sessions: advanced technology orientation, 
library orientation, and shop orientation. Within the concentrations, electives are 
categorized under four broad subject areas: history and theory of architecture and the 
city; urbanism and landscape; materials and design; and structures and computation.
Design concentration/uni2002The Design concentration explores the role of architecture in 
shaping the world around us. It introduces complex processes involved in solving 
spatial and programmatic problems. Creative work is grounded in the study of history 
and culture, and in the analysis of social conditions inﬂuencing architecture. Design 
studios provide a forum for production and discourse. Studio projects address issues 
of architectural form, space, composition, site, tectonics, and programs within broader 
humanistic ideals.
For the Design concentration, the following additional courses are required:
1.A core of four courses: the studio courses ARCH 3000 and 3001 taken during 
the junior year after the student is accepted into the major; and the history of 
architecture surveys, ARCH 2001 and 2003, to be completed by the end of the 
junior year172            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
2.One elective in history and theory of architecture and the city as outlined in the 
elective options below 
3.One elective in urbanism and landscape as outlined in the elective options below 
4.One elective in materials and design as outlined in the elective options below
5.One elective in structures and computation as outlined in the elective options 
below 
6.The senior requirement, ARCH 4000 and 4001
History, Theory, Criticism of Architecture, and Urbanism concentration/uni2002The History, 
Theory, Criticism of Architecture, and Urbanism concentration is intended to establish 
a broad historical and intellectual framework for the study of architecture and the 
city. An interdisciplinary approach is encouraged through additional courses taken in 
various ﬁelds of humanities and social sciences. Such courses may include archaeology, 
urban studies, aesthetics, philosophy, or visual culture. Permission of the director of 
undergraduate studies (DUS) is required if the courses fall outside the speciﬁed course 
of studies. During their senior year students complete a senior essay or project on a 
topic approved by the faculty.
For the History, Theory, Criticism of Architecture, and Urbanism concentration, the 
following additional courses are required:
1.A core of four courses: ARCH 3000 taken during the fall term of junior year; a 
second design studio or urban laboratory (e.g. ARCH 3301, ARCH 3305) or an 
elective approved by the DUS, taken during the spring term of junior year; and the 
history of architecture surveys ARCH 2001 and 2003 to be completed by the end of 
junior year
2.Four electives in history and theory of architecture and the city, as outlined in the 
elective options below and approved by the DUS
3.One elective in urbanism and landscape, materials and design, or structures and 
computation, or other relevant course approved by the DUS as outlined in the 
elective options below
4.The senior requirement, ARCH 4900 and 4910
