Mathematics and Philosophy
Directors of undergraduate studies: Sebastian Hurtado-Salazar (Mathematics), 
Miki Havlickova (Mathematics), Math DUS (math.dus@yale.edu); Keith DeRose 
(keith.derose@yale.edu )(Philosophy)
The Mathematics and Philosophy major allows students to explore those areas where 
philosophy and mathematics meet, in particular, mathematical and philosophical logic 
and the philosophy of mathematics.
Prerequisite
The prerequisite for the major is MATH 1200. With prior written permission from the 
Mathematics DUS, students who completed multivariable calculus during high school 
may substitute a higher level mathematics course in the same area.
Requirements of the Major
The major requires twelve term courses including the prerequisite and the senior 
seminar. Of the remaining courses, at least four must be in mathematics level 
2220-4690, and ﬁve must be in philosophy. The remaining course may be either 
a mathematics or philosophy course. All philosophy courses are eligible for credit 
toward the major, except First-Order Logic (PHIL 1115). Required courses include Set 
Theory (MATH 2700), Mathematical Logic (PHIL 2267), Computability and Logic 
(PHIL 4427), an additional advanced philosophy course with a substantive logical 
component, (other than PHIL 4427) that fulﬁlls the senior requirement (see below). 
Set Theory (MATH 2700) and Mathematical Logic (PHIL 2267) must be taken before 
the end of the junior year; it is strongly recommended that they be taken earlier.
A course must be listed with a MATH number to count toward the mathematics 
requirements—substitutions from other departments are not permitted. Graduate 
mathematics courses level 5000–5999 may be counted as electives; graduate 
mathematics courses level 6000 or above may not be counted.
Senior Requirement
Each year certain seminars oﬀered by the Mathematics and Philosophy departments are 
designated as fulﬁlling the senior requirement of the combined major. If such a seminar 
is taken to fulﬁll the senior requirement, majors must consult with the instructor and 
agree upon additional work required. Typically, additional work includes a substantial 
class presentation and/or preparation of a series of drafts prior to submission of the 
ﬁnal paper.
The mathematics seminars, numbered MATH 4800 through 4890, fulﬁll the senior 
requirement. For philosophy seminars that fulﬁll the senior requirement, consult the 
director of undergraduate studies (DUS) in Philosophy.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No more than one course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward 
the requirements of the major (including the prerequisite), with permission of the 
DUSs. The following courses must be taken for letter grades: MATH 2700, PHIL 2267, 
PHIL 4427; the required mathematics courses level 2220 or higher; the additional 
philosophy course with an advanced logic component; and the senior seminar.Mathematics and Philosophy         361
Outside credit Courses taken after matriculation at Yale at another institution or 
during an approved summer or term-time study abroad program may count toward the 
major requirements with DUS approval.
Advising
A typical program satisfying the major might consist of MATH 1200, MATH 2250 or  
MATH 2260, MATH 2700, MATH 2550, two math electives level 2220 or higher; 
PHIL 1126, PHIL 2267, 4427, two philosophy electives; a senior seminar in Mathematics 
or Philosophy.
