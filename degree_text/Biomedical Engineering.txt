Biomedical Engineering

Engineering methods and strategies are used to address biomedical problems ranging 
from studies of physiological function using images to the development of novel drug 
delivery methods and new biomaterials. The B.S. degree in Biomedical Engineering 
is designed to provide students with an understanding of common fundamental 
methodologies in biomedical engineering and the ability to develop quantitative 
approaches to one of four biomedical engineering concentrations: Bioimaging, 
Biomechanics and Mechanobiology, Biomolecular Engineering, and Systems Biology. 
The course structure of the major permits students to bridge basic concepts in the 
life sciences and traditional areas of engineering, while gaining a comprehensive 
understanding of biomedical engineering as a ﬁeld of study. The program provides 
graduates with an excellent background for graduate study in biomedical engineering 
and related areas, or in medicine and other health professions as well as for a diverse 
range of careers in industry, consulting, or government.
Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are common to all concentrations in the major: BIOL 1010
and 1020 or a higher-level course in MCDB or MB&B, with the permission of the 
director of undergraduate studies (DUS); a lecture course in chemistry numbered
CHEM 1610  or higher; MATH 1150  or MATH 1160  (not necessary if placed into
MATH 1200  or ENAS 1510); MATH 1200  or ENAS 1510; ENAS 1940; PHYS 1800,
1810 and PHYS 2050L, 2060L or PHYS 1650L, 1660L. Advanced high school 
preparation does not bypass these prerequisites; instead, students move ahead to more 
advanced courses with DUS permission.
Requirements of the Major
See Links to the attributes indicating courses approved for the Biomedical Engineering 
major requirements.
Students must complete thirteen term courses, totaling at least eleven course credits, 
beyond the prerequisites, including at least three required courses in the chosen 
concentration and the senior requirement (see below). During the ﬁrst two years, 
students study basic biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics (see prerequisites). 
By the end of the sophomore year, students should have taken BENG 2080 , 2800, and
3200. In the junior year, students gain a comprehensive grounding in the ﬁeld through
BENG 3600 , 3400, 3500, 3100, and 3110. During the junior and senior years, students 
acquire depth by taking electives in one of the four concentrations. One relevant 
course (e.g. MB&B 3000 ) may be substituted with DUS permission. A senior seminar 
(BENG 4080 ) provides information about the ﬁeld and a senior project (BENG 4974  or
BENG 4973 , 4974) allows students to explore an area in depth.
Students in all concentrations are required to take the following courses: BENG 2800 ,
2080, 3200, 3600, 3400, 3500, 3100, 3110, and 4080.Biomedical Engineering          185
Students in the Bioimaging concentration (YC BENG Bioimaging) must also take 
three courses chosen from, e.g., BENG 4104 , 4106, 4410, 4440, 4450, 4849, 4475, 4476, 
or 4485.
Students in the Biomechanics  and Mechanobiology concentration (YC BENG 
Biomchncs&Mchnbiology) must also take three courses chosen from, e.g., MENG 1105 ,
3422, BENG 4104 , 4106, 4410, 4622, 4560, or 4580.
Students in either the Biomolecular Engineering concentration (YC BENG Biomolecular 
Engrng) or the Systems Biology concentration (YC BENG Systems Biology) must also 
take three courses chosen from, e.g., BENG 4104 , 4106, 4410, 4611, 4622, 4350, 4630,
4261, 4767, 4680, 4690, MENG 3422 .
Research courses Students are permitted and encouraged to engage in research before 
the senior year by enrolling in BENG 4971  and/or BENG 4972 . These courses, oﬀered 
Pass/Fail, may be taken more than once for credit.
Credit/D/Fail No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of the major, including prerequisites.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
In their sophomore year, all students must enroll in BENG 2080  and in their senior 
year, all students must enroll in BENG 4080 ; both are half-credit courses. They must 
also complete a one-term senior project in their ﬁnal term of enrollment (BENG 4974 ) 
or a two-term, yearlong project (BENG 4973 , 4974).
Advising
Preparation for graduate study The Biomedical Engineering curriculum is excellent 
preparation for graduate study in engineering, science, and medicine.
Combined B.S./M.S. degree program/uni2002Exceptionally able and well-prepared students 
may apply to complete a course of study leading to the simultaneous award of the B.S. 
and M.S. degrees after eight terms of enrollment. See Academic Regulations, section 
L, Special Academic Arrangements, “Simultaneous Award of the Bachelor’s and 
Master’s Degrees.” Interested students should consult the DUS prior to the sixth term 
of enrollment for speciﬁc requirements in Biomedical Engineering.
