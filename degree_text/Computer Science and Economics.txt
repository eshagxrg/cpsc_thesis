Computer Science and Economics
Director of undergraduate studies: Philipp Strack (philipp.strack@yale.edu)
Computer Science and Economics (CSEC) is an interdepartmental major for students 
interested in the theoretical and practical connections between computer science and 
economics. The B.S. degree in CSEC provides students with foundational knowledge 
of economics, computation, and data analysis, as well as hands-on experience with 
empirical analysis of economic data. It prepares students for professional careers 
that incorporate aspects of both economics and computer science and for academic 
careers conducting research in the overlap of the two ﬁelds. Topics in the overlap 
include market design, computational ﬁnance, economics of online platforms, machine 
learning, and social media. The CSEC major requires some classes in the intersection 
between Computer Science and Economics which are not mandatory for either major.
Prerequisites
Prerequisite to this major is a basic understanding of discrete math, calculus, 
microeconomics, and macroeconomics. Grades of 4 or 5 on high-school AP computer 
science, statistics, calculus, microeconomics, and macroeconomics signal adequate 
preparation for required courses in the CSEC major. For students who have not taken 
these or equivalent courses in high school, the discrete mathematics prerequisite may 
be satisﬁed with CPSC 2020  or MATH 2440 ; the calculus prerequisite may be satisﬁed 
with MATH 1120 ; the microeconomics prerequisite may be satisﬁed with ECON 1110
or ECON 1115; and the macroeconomics prerequisite may be satisﬁed with ECON 1111
or ECON 1116. Other courses may suﬃce, and students should consult the director of 
undergraduate studies (DUS) and their academic advisers if they are unsure whether 
they have the prerequisite knowledge for a particular required course.
Requirements of the Major
See Links to the attributes indicating courses approved for the Computer Science and 
Math Requirements (YC CSEC Elective not CS or EC; YC CSEC Elctv intrsectn CS/EC).
The B.S. degree program requires successful completion of fourteen term courses 
(not including courses taken to satisfy prerequisites) and the senior project. Nine of 
the fourteen courses are listed below; the remaining ﬁve courses are electives. With 
permission of the DUS and the academic adviser, a student may substitute a more 
advanced course in the same area as a required course. When a substitution is made, 
the advanced course counts toward the nine required courses and not toward the ﬁve 
electives.
The required courses include CPSC 2010 ; 2230; 3230; 3650 or 3660; ECON 2121
or 2125; two courses in econometrics (ECON 1117 and 2123 or ECON 2135 and
ECON 2136); one course in game theory ECON 3351 or CPSC 4550 ; one course in the 
intersection of computer science and economics (e.g., CPSC 4550 , ECON 4417, 4433,
4486, 4441, 4435, 4478 or CPSC 4740 ) which may not also count as one of the ﬁve 
remaining electives or for the game theory requirement. S&DS 2410  and 2420 may be 
taken instead of ECON 2135. Only CPSC 3650  or CPSC 3660  may be taken for major 
credit.
Elective courses are essentially those courses that count as electives in the Computer 
Science major, the Economics major, or both. ECON 2122, ECON 2159, andComputer Science and Economics          225
ECON 6672 can count as Economics electives. S&DS 3650  can count as an elective in a 
related ﬁeld. At least two electives must be taken in the Computer Science department, 
and at least one must be taken in the Economics department. With the permission 
of the academic adviser, a student may use as the fourth and/or ﬁfth elective (one or 
two courses) in related departments that do not usually serve as electives in Computer 
Science or Economics.

Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of the major.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
In the senior year, each student must complete CSEC 4910, a one-term independent-
project course that explicitly combines both techniques and subject matter from 
computer science and economics. A project proposal must be approved by the student’s 
academic adviser and project adviser, and it must be signed by the DUS by the end of 
the third week of the term.
Distinction in the Major/uni2002Computer Science and Economics majors may earn 
Distinction in the Major if they receive grades of A or A– in at least three quarters 
of their courses in the major (not including courses taken to satisfy prerequisites), 
and their senior-project advisers determine that their senior projects are worthy of 
distinction.
Advising
Approval of course schedules/uni2002Students considering the major but not yet declared 
should arrange to meet with the DUS during the registration period to ensure that their 
proposed course schedules are appropriate. Similarly, declared majors should meet with 
their academic advisers to ensure that they are on track to satisfy all of the requirements 
of the major. Course schedules must be signed by the DUS each term, and they must be 
approved by an academic adviser before the DUS signs them.
Transfer credit/uni2002Students who take a term abroad or take summer courses outside of 
Yale may petition the DUS to count at most two courses from outside Yale toward 
the requirements of the major. Students who take a year abroad may petition to count 
at most three courses. Many courses taken outside Yale do not meet the standards of 
the CSEC major; therefore, students should consult with their academic advisers and 
the DUS before taking such courses. Courses taken outside Yale may not be counted 
toward the major requirements in intermediate microeconomics, econometrics, or the 
intersection of computer science and economics.
