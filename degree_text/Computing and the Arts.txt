Computing and the Arts
Director of undergraduate studies: Scott Petersen (scott.petersen@yale.edu)
Computing and the Arts is an interdepartmental major designed for students who wish 
to integrate work in computing with work in one of ﬁve arts disciplines: architecture, 
art, history of art, music, or theater, dance, and performance studies.
For students with a computing perspective, issues in these disciplines present 
interesting and substantive problems: how musicians use computers to compose; the 
limitations of current software tools used by artists; the types of analyses done by art 
historians; challenges in designing and using virtual sets in the theater; ways that 
virtual worlds might help to envision new forms of artistic expression; and lessons that 
can be learned from trying to create a robotic conductor or performer.
For students with an artistic perspective, computing methods oﬀer a systematic 
approach to achieving their vision. A foundation in computer science allows artists to 
understand existing computing tools more comprehensively and to use them more 
eﬀectively. Furthermore, it gives them insight into what fundamentally can and cannot 
be done with computers, so they can anticipate the future development of new tools for 
computing in their ﬁeld.
Prerequisites 
The prerequisite for all students in the major is CPSC 1001  which should be taken 
during the ﬁrst year. There are two additional prerequisites for the Art concentration,
ART 1111 and ART 1514. There are two additional prerequisites for the Theater, Dance, 
and Performance Studies concentration, TDPS 1000  and TDPS 1001 . There are no 
additional prerequisites for the Architecture, History of Art, or Music concentrations. 
There is no required favorable review of studio work for admission to the major in 
any concentration, but a sophomore review advising session is required for the Art 
concentration.
Requirements of the Major
See Links to attributes indicating Computer Science courses approved for Computing 
and the Arts major requirements.
Twelve term courses are required beyond the prerequisites, not including the two-term 
senior project. Six of the courses must be in Computer Science, including CPSC 2010 ,
2020, and 2230. Students are advised to complete CPSC 2020  and 2230 by the end of the 
sophomore year. MATH 2440  may be substituted for CPSC 2020 . The six remaining 
courses are selected from one of the arts disciplines. Students choose a concentration in 
architecture, art, history of art, music, or theater, dance, and performance studies. All 
requirements for a single concentration must be satisﬁed, as speciﬁed below.
The Architecture concentration requires the following courses in addition to the Computer 
Science courses listed above: (1) ARCH 1001 and ARCH 2000; (2) two courses 
from ARCH 2001, 2003, 3304, and 3305; (3) two elective courses from either of the 
two Architecture speciﬁc concentrations: Design; or History, Theory, Criticism of 
Architecture, and Urbanism; (4) two courses from CPSC 3760 , CPSC 4381 , 4460, 4510,
4750, 4780, 4790, or 4840; and (5) one additional intermediate or advanced CPSC 
course (excluding CPSC 4900 ). Computing and the Arts          235
The Art concentration requires the following courses in addition to the Computer 
Science courses listed above, as well as a sophomore review at the School of Art: 
(1) two 1000-level courses beyond ART 1111 and ART 1514, such as ART 1732 and/
or ART 1784 or ART 1985; (2) two courses in Art at the 2000 or 3000 level, such as
ART 2985 and/or ART 3770; (3) ART 3995; (4) ART 4995; (5) two courses selected 
from CPSC 3760 , CPSC 4381 , 4460, 4510, 4750, 4780, 4790, or 4840; (6) one additional 
intermediate or advanced Computer Science course (excluding CPSC 4900 ). Seniors 
following the art concentration will have access to a shared studio and many facilities in 
the School of Art.
The History of Art concentration requires the following courses in addition to the 
Computer Science courses listed above: (1) one introductory, 1000-level, History 
of Art course; (2) two History of Art courses at the 2000, 3000, or 4000 level (the 
courses must represent two diﬀerent areas as deﬁned in the History of Art program 
description); (3) one studio art course (students may need to take a prerequisite course 
in Art to prepare for the studio course); (4) HSAR 4401; (5) one 4000-level seminar in 
History of Art; (6) two courses selected from CPSC 3760 , CPSC 4381 , 4510, 4750, 4780, 
or 4790, one of which must be CPSC 4780  or 4790; (7) one additional intermediate or 
advanced Computer Science course (excluding CPSC 4900 ).
The Music concentration requires the following courses in addition to the Computer 
Science courses listed above: (1) two courses from Group I (Music Theory); (2) 
three additional courses from Group I or Group II (Creative Practices); (3) one course 
from Group III (Western Art Music) or Group IV (World and Popular Music); (4)
CPSC 4310 ; (5) CPSC 4320 ; (6) one additional intermediate or advanced Computer 
Science course (excluding CPSC 4900 ).
The Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies concentration requires the following courses 
in addition to the prerequisites and Computer Science courses listed above: (1) one 
course in the Artistic Practice domain; (2) one course in the Histories domain; (3) one 
course in the Performance Theory domain; (4) one course in the Interarts domain; (5) 
two additional courses in any of the domains; (6) CPSC 4310  or 4320; (7) CPSC 4780 ,
4790, or CPSC 4840 ; (8) one additional intermediate or advanced Computer Science 
course (excluding CPSC 4900 ).
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of the major.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement 
The senior project requires two terms: one term of CPSC 4900 , and one term 
of ARCH 4910, ART 4996, HSAR 4499, one from MUSI 4996–4999, or one 
from TDPS 4701 , 4900 or 4901, depending on the concentration chosen. The project 
must be approved by the DUS and be acceptable to both departments. Students must 
submit a written report, including an electronic abstract and webpage(s).236            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
