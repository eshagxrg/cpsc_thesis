College Seminars Program         213
College Seminars Program
The Residential College Seminar Program is designed to enhance the intellectual life 
of the residential colleges by oﬀering courses that fall outside typical departmental 
structures, often taught by instructors whose professional life lies outside the university. 
Each residential college sponsors one seminar each term, and a deﬁning feature of the 
program is that undergraduates play a central role in the seminar selection process. 
Each residential college has a student committee responsible for evaluating seminar 
proposals and interviewing candidates.
Course descriptions for c ollege seminars for the fall and spring terms can be found in
Yale Course Search. Students may search for college seminars by selecting YC College 
Seminar under the "Any Department" dropdown in the left side search panel. The 
online listings contain course titles, descriptions, and prerequisites. Course syllabuses 
are available on Canvas @ Yale.
Students apply to college seminars during registration. Students from the sponsoring 
college have priority admission to the ﬁrst six roster spots in each seminar. Students 
may apply to no more than two college seminars in a given term and may only enroll in 
one college seminar per term,  with a maximum of four college seminars in their Yale 
College career. Auditing is not permitted in college seminars. See the YCPS, K. Special 
Academic Programs, Limit on Residential College Seminars, for more information.
