Environmental Engineering

Environmental engineering encompasses the scientiﬁc assessment and development 
of engineering solutions to environmental problems aﬀecting land, water, and air (the 
biosphere). The ﬁeld addresses broad environmental issues, including the safety of 
drinking water, groundwater protection and remediation, wastewater treatment, indoor 
and outdoor air pollution, climate change, solid and hazardous waste disposal, cleanup 
of contaminated sites, the prevention of pollution through product and process design, 
and strategies for sustainable water and energy use and production.
Environmental engineers must balance competing technical, social, and legal 
issues concerning the use of environmental resources. Because of the complexity 
of these challenges, environmental engineers need a broad understanding not only 
of engineering disciplines but also of chemistry, biology, geology, and economics. 
Accordingly, the program allows students in the major to select an emphasis on 
environmental engineering technology, sustainability, global health, economics, or 
energy and climate change. The program prepares students for leadership positions 
in industry and government agencies or for further studies in engineering, science, 
business, law, and medicine.
Two degree programs are oﬀered: the B.S. in Environmental Engineering, and the B.A. 
in Engineering Sciences (Environmental). The B.S. degree program in Environmental 
Engineering is designed for students who desire a strong background in environmental 
engineering leading to a career in the ﬁeld. The B.A. degree program in Engineering 
Sciences (Environmental) is intended for students whose careers will involve, but 
not be dominated by, the skills of environmental engineering. The B.A. program is 
appropriate for those contemplating a career in which scientiﬁc and technological 
problems can play an important role, as is often the case in law, business, medicine, or 
public service.
Students are held to the requirements in place when they declared 
their major. However, with approval from the director of undergraduate studies 
(DUS), the following prerequisites and major requirements, updated for the academic 
year 2023-2024, may be fulﬁlled by students who declared the major in a prior term.
Prerequisites 
B.A. degree program in Engineering Sciences (Environmental)/uni2002The B.A. degree 
program requires MATH 1120  and MATH 1150 ; a two-term lecture sequence in 
chemistry; and PHYS 1700, 1710.
B.S. degree program in Environmental Engineering/uni2002The B.S. degree program has the 
following prerequisites in mathematics and basic sciences: MATH 1120 , MATH 1150 ;
MATH 1200  or ENAS 1510; ENAS 1940; ENAS 1300 or S&DS 2300 ; a two-term lecture 
sequence in chemistry, with corresponding labs; PHYS 1800, 1810; BIOL 1010  and
BIOL 1020  or BIOL 1030  and 1040.Environmental Engineering         287
Requirements of the Major 
B.A. degree program  The B.A. degree program requires nine term course 
credits beyond the prerequisites, including the senior requirement. Students 
take ENVE 1200, ENVE 3600, and either ENVE 3730 or 3770. Five electives must be 
chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies (DUS). Elective 
courses may build toward an optional concentrated area of emphasis, including (a) 
Climate and Energy, (b) Environmental Science and Technology, (c) Sustainability and 
Policy, and (d) Self-designed.   
B.S. degree program/uni2002The B.S. degree program requires at least thirteen term course 
credits beyond the prerequisites, including the senior requirement. Students take 
CENG 3000 or MENG 2511; ENVE 1200; 3600; 3730; 3140 or 4480; 4380; 4410; and 
ENVE 6420. At least four electives must be chosen in consultation with the DUS; of 
these, three must be technical electives. Elective courses may build toward an optional 
concentrated area of emphasis, including (a) Climate and Energy, (b) Environmental 
Science and Technology, (c) Sustainability and Policy, and (d) Self-designed.   
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of the major, including prerequisites.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval
Senior Requirement
B.A. degree program Students in the B.A. program must pass ENVE 4160
or ENVE 4900 in their senior year.
B.S. degree program/uni2002Students in the B.S. program must pass ENVE 4160 or 
ENVE 4900 in their senior year.
