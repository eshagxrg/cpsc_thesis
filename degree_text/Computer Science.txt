Computer Science
Director of undergraduate studies: Theodore Kim
(theodore.kim@yale.edu); cpsc.yale.edu
The Department of Computer Science oﬀers both B.S. and B.A. degree programs and 
four combined major programs in cooperation with other departments: Electrical 
Engineering and Computer Science, Computer Science and Economics, Computer 
Science and Mathematics, and Computer Science and Psychology. Each program not 
only provides a solid technical education in the core of computer science but also allows 
students to take a broad range of courses in other disciplines that are an essential part of 
a liberal arts education.
Speciﬁcally, the Computer Science and combined major programs share a common core 
of ﬁve computer science courses. The ﬁrst is CPSC 2010 , a survey that demonstrates 
the breadth and depth of the ﬁeld to students who have taken the equivalent of 
an introductory programming course. The remaining core courses cover discrete 
mathematics (CPSC 2020  or MATH 2440 ), data structures (CPSC 2230 ), systems 
programming and computer architecture (CPSC 3230 ), and algorithm analysis and 
design (CPSC 3650  or 3660). Only one of CPSC 3650  or 3660 may be taken for major 
credit. Together these courses include the material that every major should know.
The core courses are supplemented by electives (and, for a combined major, core 
courses in the other discipline) that oﬀer great ﬂexibility in tailoring a program to each 
student's interests. The capstone is the senior project (CPSC 4900 ), through which 
students experience the challenges and rewards of original research under the guidance 
of a faculty adviser.
Prospective majors are encouraged to discuss their programs with the director of 
undergraduate studies (DUS) as early as possible.
Introductory Courses
The department oﬀers a broad range of introductory courses to meet 
the needs of students with varying backgrounds and interests. Except 
for CPSC 2000  and CPSC 2010 , none assumes previous knowledge of computers.
1.CPSC 1001  teaches students majoring in any subject area how to program 
a computer and solve problems. No prior programming experience is 
required. Students with previous programming experience should consider 
taking CPSC 2010  instead. This course satisﬁes the Quantitative Reasoning 
distributional requirement.
2.CPSC 1100  teaches programming for humanities and social sciences using 
the Python programming language. No prior programming experience is 
required. This course satisﬁes the Quantitative Reasoning distributional 
requirement.
3.CPSC 1340  provides an introduction to computer music, including musical 
representations for computing, automated music analysis and composition, 
interactive systems, and virtual instrument design.
4.CPSC 1500  explores how some of the key ideas in computer science have 
aﬀected philosophy of mind, cognitivism, connectionism, and related areas. This Computer Science          219
humanities-style course requires a signiﬁcant amount of reading and writing 
a paper, and satisﬁes the Writing and the Humanities and Arts distributional 
requirements.
5.CPSC 1510  studies the history of the graphical user interface in an attempt to guess 
its future. This course satisﬁes the Writing distributional requirement.
6.CPSC 1750  studies the C programming language and the Linux operating system. 
This course satisﬁes the Quantitative Reasoning requirement.
7.CPSC 1830  explores the myriad ways that law and technology intersect, with a 
special focus on the role of cyberspace. This course satisﬁes the Social Sciences 
distributional requirement.
8.CPSC 1840  focuses on the evolving and oftentimes vexing intellectual property 
regime of the new digital age. This course satisﬁes the Social Sciences and the 
Humanities and Arts distributional requirements.
9.CPSC 1850  covers the evolution of various legal doctrines with and around 
technological development. This course satisﬁes the Social Sciences and the Writing 
distributional requirements.
10.CPSC 2000 , intended as a survey course for non-majors, focuses on practical 
applications of computing technology while examining topics including computer 
hardware, computer software, and related issues such as security and software 
engineering. This course satisﬁes the Quantitative Reasoning distributional 
requirement.
11.CPSC 2010  teaches the basic concepts, techniques, and applications of computer 
science, including systems (computers and their languages) and theory (complexity 
and computability). Students with suﬃcient programming experience may elect
CPSC 2010  without taking CPSC 1001 . (These courses meet at the same time so 
that students are easily able to change levels if necessary.) This course satisﬁes the 
Quantitative Reasoning distributional requirement.
12.CPSC 2020  presents the formal methods of reasoning and the concepts of 
discrete mathematics and linear algebra used in computer science and related 
disciplines. This course satisﬁes the Quantitative Reasoning distributional 
requirement.
Requirements of the Major
See Link to the YC CPSC Elective attribute  indicating courses approved for

The B.S. and the B.A. degree programs have the same required ﬁve core courses:
CPSC 2010 ; CPSC 2020  or MATH 2440 ; CPSC 2230 ; CPSC 3230 ; and CPSC 3650  or
3660.
B.S. degree program The B.S. degree program requires a total of twelve term courses: 
ﬁve core courses, six intermediate or advanced courses in Computer Science, and the 
senior requirement.
B.A. degree program The B.A. degree program requires a total of ten term courses: the 
ﬁve core courses, four intermediate or advanced courses in Computer Science, and the 
senior requirement.220            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
Combined B.S./M.S. degree Exceptionally able and well-prepared students may 
complete a course of study leading to the simultaneous award of the B.S. and 
M.S. degrees after eight terms of enrollment. General eligibility requirements 
are described in the Academic Regulations, section L, Special Academic 
Arrangements, “Simultaneous Award of the Bachelor's and Master's Degrees.” Speciﬁc 
requirements for the combined degree in Computer Science are as follows:
1.Candidates must satisfy the Yale College requirements for the B.S. degree in 
Computer Science.
2.At the end of their ﬁfth term of enrollment, candidates must have earned at least 
nine of their Computer Science required course credits, which together with three 
additional Computer Science required course credits, satisfy the requirements for 
the B.S. in Computer Science. Candidates must also have achieved A grades (only 
A, not A-) in at least three-quarters of these courses.
3.Candidates must also complete eight graduate courses from the approved list, up 
to two of which may, with the permission of the DUS and the director of graduate 
studies, also be applied toward completion of the B.S. degree. At most one of these 
eight courses may be CPSC 6920 . All eight graduate courses must be completed 
in the ﬁnal four terms of enrollment, and at least six of them must be completed 
in the ﬁnal three terms of enrollment.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of the major. All courses in the major must be taken for a letter grade.
Outside credit/uni2002Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
In the senior year, students must take CPSC 4900 , an independent project course, in 
which a student selects an adviser to conduct original research with substantial work 
in a subﬁeld of computer science. With permission of the DUS, students may enroll 
in 4900 more than once or before their senior year.
Advising
All Computer Science majors in the sophomore, junior, and senior years should review 
their programs with their class advisers and the DUS. Students majoring in Computer 
Science are advised to complete CPSC 2010  and 2230 by the end of their sophomore 
year.
Electives The ﬁeld of computer science has broadened substantially in the last 
few decades and the Computer Science department advises its majors to choose 
intermediate and advanced electives covering the breadth of computer science, 
including theoretical computer science; computer systems and languages (e.g., 
database, networking, operating systems, programming languages, and systems 
security); and computer applications (e.g., artiﬁcial intelligence, computer graphics, 
computer vision, human-computer interactions, machine learning, natural language 
processing, and robotics).
The Computer Science department encourages interdisciplinary study in which 
computer science plays a major role. Advanced courses in other departments that Computer Science          221
involve concepts from computer science and are relevant to an individual program may, 
with permission of the DUS, be counted toward the requirements, but no more than 
two such courses may be counted toward the B.S., and no more than one toward the 
B.A.
Students interested in using computers to solve scientiﬁc and engineering problems 
are advised to take CPSC 4371  as well as computational courses oﬀered in Applied 
Mathematics and in Engineering and Applied Science.
The core mathematical background necessary to complete the Computer Science major 
is provided in CPSC 2020 . However, many advanced courses in graphics, computer 
vision, neural networks, and numerical analysis assume additional knowledge of linear 
algebra and calculus. Students who plan to take such courses as electives and who are 
unsure whether they have the appropriate mathematical background are encouraged to 
take MATH 2220  or 2250, MATH 2260 , and MATH 1200 .
Typical programs For students who already know how to program, typical B.S. 
programs starting in the ﬁrst and sophomore years are indicated below. For typical B.A. 
programs, two of the electives would be omitted.

Certiﬁcate in Programming
Certiﬁcate director: Ozan Erat, DL 423; cpsc.yale.edu
The Certiﬁcate in Programming prepares students to program computers in support 
of work in any area of study. While the certiﬁcate does not provide the grounding in 222            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
theory and systems that the computer science majors do, it does provide a short path 
to programming literacy that can be completed in a span of four terms. Majors in 
Computer Science, and in the joint programs with Economics, Electrical Engineering, 
Mathematics, and Psychology, or in Computing and the Arts may not pursue the 
Certiﬁcate.
Refer to the Computer Science website for more information.
Prerequisite
The prerequisite for the Certiﬁcate is an introductory programming course, CPSC 1100 ,
1001, S115 or successful completion of an AP Computer Science course.
