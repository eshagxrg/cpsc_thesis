Physics and Geosciences

Pincelli H
ull (pincelli.hull@yale.edu) (Earth and Planetary Sciences)
The major in Physics and Geosciences applies fundamental physical principles to the 
study of the Earth and other planetary bodies, synthesizing concepts and methods from 
both the Physics majors and the Earth and Planetary Sciences majors.
Prerequisites 
The prerequisites for the major include MATH 1200 or its equivalent, PHYS 1700, 
PHYS 1710 or another introductory physics sequence, the physics laboratory 
course PHYS 2050L, and a course in ordinary di ﬀerential equations chosen from 
ENAS 1940, MATH 2460, or PHYS 4000.
Requirements of the Major 
Students are held to the requirements that were in place when they declared their 
major. However, with approval from the DUS, the following requirements, updated for 
the academic year 2025–2026, may be fulﬁlled by students who declared the major in a 
prior term.
Beyond the prerequisites, the major requires twelve and a half course credits 
(thirteen course credits if the EPS introductory course has an accompanying 
laboratory), including the senior project. At least four and a half of these course credits 
must be in Physics and at least six must be in Earth and Planetary Sciences. Students 
complete PHYS 2060L and a two- or three-term advanced physics sequence: either 
PHYS 4010 and PHYS 4020, or PHYS 4100, PHYS 4500, and PHYS 4300. They must 
also take basic quantum mechanics (PHYS 4390 or PHYS 4400) and one elective 
numbered PHYS 3000 or above. Relevant classes in related departments may be 
substituted with the permission of the DUS in Physics. Required courses in Earth and 
Planetary Sciences include one introductory course numbered EPS 1000–1400, with 
any accompanying laboratory; one elective numbered EPS 2000 or above; and four 
advanced electives from one of two EPS tracks: the Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate 
track or the Solid Earth Science track. Relevant classes in related departments may 
be substituted with the permission of the DUS in Earth and Planetary Sciences. No 
elective course may count toward multiple requirements for the major.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be counted toward the requirements 
of the major, including prerequisites.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
te
rm-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement 
Students complete a two-term senior project on a topic that is appropriate for the 
combined major and acceptable to both the Physics and the Earth and Planetary 
Sciences departments. The project is undertaken in either PHYS 4710 and 4720 or 
EPS 4900 and EPS 4910. In addition, students must present an oral report on their 
project to each department.Physics and Geosciences         415
Advising 
Interested students should consult the directors of undergraduate studies (DUSs) in 
Physics and in Earth and Planetary Sciences.
