The wide range of courses oﬀered by the Department of Chemistry reﬂects the position 
of chemistry as the foundation of all the molecular sciences. In addition to graduate 
work in chemistry, biochemistry, or health-related disciplines, the department's 
graduates ﬁnd their broad scientiﬁc training useful in ﬁelds such as technology policy, 
business management, and law. Chemistry is an especially appropriate major for 
students interested in energy research or policy and the environment.
Courses for Nonmajors without Prerequisites
The Chemistry department oﬀers one-term courses with no prerequisites, which 
are intended for non–science majors. These courses do not satisfy medical school 
requirements or the general chemistry requirement for any science major. Courses for 
nonmajors are numbered CHEM 1000–1090.
Prerequisites and Introductory Courses
Prerequisite courses Required prerequisites for the Chemistry degree programs 
are: two terms of general chemistry and laboratory; single-variable calculus at 
the level of MATH 1150  or MATH 1160 ; and one term of introductory physics 
numbered 1700 or higher, or advanced placement beyond these levels in math or 
physics. Students also are encouraged to complete a course in multivariable calculus 
(MATH 1200 , MATH 1210 , or ENAS 1510); these courses or more advanced math 
courses fulﬁll the math prerequisite. All prerequisite courses must be taken for a letter 
grade; if they are taken as Audit or Credit/D/Fail they will not satisfy the requirement.
Introductory courses/uni2002The majority of students begin with the general chemistry 
sequence CHEM 1610  and 1650 or with CHEM 1700  (note: the general chemistry 
sequence CHEM 1630  and 1670 is not oﬀered AY 2025-2026). These courses fulﬁll the 
prerequisite for general chemistry in the Chemistry major. Students taking CHEM 1610
may be studying chemistry for the ﬁrst time, perhaps took chemistry as a high school 
sophomore, or even may have completed AP chemistry but did not fully master the 
subject at that level. Students in CHEM 1700  have completed a year or two of chemistry 
later in high school, although motivated students may have last taken chemistry as a 
high-school sophomore if they have a strong math and physics background. Typically 
students who complete CHEM 1700  in the fall term complete Organic Chemistry 
(CHEM 2200  and CHEM 2220L ) in the spring term. Regardless of whether a student 
completes the CHEM 1610  and 1650 sequence or CHEM 1700 , the introductory 
laboratory sequence is CHEM 1340L , 1360L, or CHEM 1710L ; each laboratory course is 
worth one-half course credit.
Students with a suﬃciently strong background in chemistry may initiate their studies 
with courses in organic or physical chemistry after demonstrating proﬁciency on the 
department’s placement examination. While CHEM 1740  and 1750 are oﬀered only 
to ﬁrst-year students, other courses in organic chemistry, including CHEM 2200
and 2210, also are available to qualiﬁed ﬁrst-year students. Students with a strong 
background in physics and calculus may be eligible for the physical chemistry coursesChemistry         193
CHEM 3320  and 3330 in the ﬁrst year if they have fulﬁlled the math and physics 
requirements.
Placement Procedures
Details about placement and preregistration for chemistry courses can be found on the
department website. Information about the diﬀerent degree programs, advising, and 
undergraduate research also are available on the department website.
Permission Enrollment in CHEM 1700  or CHEM 1740  through the registration system 
requires permission from the department. Permission is issued automatically after 
placement has been completed for entering ﬁrst-year students. For more information 
email chemistry.dus@yale.edu.
Upper-level students Upper-level students wishing to take CHEM 1610  or 1630
(note, CHEM 1630  is not oﬀered AY 2025-2026) should conﬁrm their placement on
Canvas@Yale by accessing the Chemistry Placement site that corresponds to their 
year of matriculation. If permission is required in the registration system, upper-
level students should write to chemistry.dus@yale.edu. Those wishing to enroll in
CHEM 2200  may do so as long as they have satisﬁed the general chemistry prerequisite.
Section registration in laboratory and lecture courses Information about online 
registration for laboratory and discussion sections can be found in the description for 
each laboratory or lecture course in Yale Course Search.
Advanced courses All chemistry advanced lecture courses numbered 4000 and 
higher are half-semester courses and count for one-half Yale College credits. These 
courses are held in the ﬁrst half of the semester or in the second half of the semester. 
Information about the timing of courses is available in Yale Course Search. Because 
most advanced courses are oﬀered either in the fall term or have a fall-term course 
as a prerequisite, students should give consideration to the advanced courses 
they plan to take in the spring term. For the purpose of degree requirements, all 
undergraduate Chemistry courses numbered 4010 or higher, approved by the director 
of undergraduate studies (DUS), typically count as advanced lecture or laboratory 
courses, as do CHEM 2260L , 2510L, 3310L, 3490L, 3550L, and 3350L. Many graduate-
level Chemistry courses (those numbered 5000 and above) also may count toward the 
advanced-course requirement; consult the DUS for information about eligible courses.
For premedical students Medical schools currently require one year of organic 
chemistry and laboratory as well as one year of general chemistry and laboratory. The 
general chemistry requirement may be satisﬁed by completing CHEM 1610  and 1650,
CHEM 1700  (CHEM 1630  and 1670 are not oﬀered AY 2025-2026), or two terms of 
physical chemistry. Students should consult with the Oﬃce of Career Strategy for the 
most up-to-date premedical course advice.
Requirements of the Major
See Links to the attributes indicating courses approved for the Chemistry 
major requirements.
Four degree programs are oﬀered: the B.A., the B.S., an intensive major leading to the 
B.S., and the combined B.S./M.S. The B.A. degree is intended for students who want 
solid training in the chemical sciences and who also intend to study other subjects in 
which chemical training would be an asset, such as technology policy, economics, or the 194            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
environment. The B.S. degree is intended to prepare students for graduate study while 
permitting extensive exploration of other disciplines and is also recommended for those 
planning to attend graduate school. The B.S. degree with an intensive major provides 
more focused preparation for a career in chemical research, and requires greater breadth 
in laboratory courses and electives. The combined B.S./M.S. is designed for students 
whose advanced preparation qualiﬁes them for graduate-level work in their third and 
fourth years of college.
The major requires a group of prerequisites or their equivalent in advanced placement, 
a core of courses common to all four degree programs, advanced courses speciﬁc to each 
degree program, and a senior requirement.
Course requirements common to all Chemistry degree programs All degrees require 
the following 5 credits with two terms of organic chemistry (CHEM 1740  or 2200, and
CHEM 1750 , or 2210, or CHEM 2300 ) with laboratory (CHEM 2220L  and 2230L), 
one term of physical chemistry (CHEM 3320  or 3280), and one term of inorganic 
chemistry (CHEM 2520 ).
B.A. degree program The B.A. degree program requires ten course credits beyond 
the prerequisites. In addition to the common degree requirements and one-term 
senior requirement, the B.A. degree requires four additional course credits of advanced 
chemistry lecture or laboratory courses. At least one full credit must be attained through 
advanced lecture courses in the Chemistry department and at least one must be a 
Chemistry laboratory course. CHEM 3330  may be counted toward the advanced-course 
requirement, although not as the sole lecture course.
B.S. degree program The B.S. degree program requires thirteen course credits beyond 
the prerequisites. In addition to the common degree requirements and two-term senior 
requirement, the B.S. degree requires completion of a second term of physical chemistry 
(CHEM 3330 ), one term of physical chemistry laboratory (CHEM 3300L ), and four 
additional course credits of advanced chemistry lecture or laboratory courses. At least 
one full credit must be attained through advanced lecture courses in the Chemistry 
department and at least one must be a Chemistry laboratory course.
B.S. degree program, intensive major The B.S. degree program, intensive major 
requires ﬁfteen course credits beyond the prerequisites. In addition to the common 
degree requirements and two-term senior requirement, the B.S. degree with an 
intensive major requires completion of a second term of introductory physics numbered 
1700 or higher, a second term of physical chemistry (CHEM 3330 ), one term of physical 
chemistry laboratory (CHEM 3300L ), and ﬁve additional course credits of advanced 
chemistry lecture or laboratory courses. At least two full credits must be attained 
through advanced lecture courses in the Chemistry department and at least one must be 
a Chemistry laboratory course.
Combined B.S./M.S. degree Exceptionally well-prepared students may complete a 
course of study leading to the simultaneous award of the B.S. and M.S. degrees after 
eight terms of enrollment. Formal application for admission to this program must 
be made no later than the last day of classes in the ﬁfth term of enrollment. To be 
considered for admission, by the end of their ﬁfth term applicants must have achieved 
at least two-thirds A or A– grades in all of their course credits as well as in all of the 
course credits directly relating to the major, including prerequisites. Two terms ofChemistry         195
CHEM 4900  must be taken in the ﬁfth and sixth terms with earned grades of A or A– 
to continue in the program. The B.S./M.S. degree program requires completion of 
the intensive major requirements, including the senior requirement, which typically is 
completed in the ﬁfth and sixth terms. The introductory physics requirement must be 
fulﬁlled with PHYS 2000 and 2010 or PHYS 2600 and 2610; a term course in physics 
numbered 4000 or higher and approved by the Chemistry DUS may be substituted for 
the introductory sequence. In addition, eight credits of graduate courses in chemistry 
(four of which count toward the B.S.) are required. Four terms of research are required, 
including two terms of research taken in CHEM 9900 . Students in the program 
must earn grades of A in at least two of their graduate-level term courses (or in one 
yearlong course) and have at least a B average in other graduate-level courses. B.S./
M.S. candidates also are expected to continue their independent research in a summer 
internship between their junior and senior years. At the end of their eighth semester 
students are required to write a thesis summarizing their research activities. The thesis 
must be written under the guidance of the faculty member who supervises the student's 
research and it must be submitted to their research adviser on the ﬁnal day of classes of 
the student's eighth semester. The thesis should be no shorter than twenty-ﬁve pages 
(double-spaced, twelve-point font, excluding ﬁgures, tables, and bibliography) and 
normally should contain the following sections: Introduction, Results and Discussion, 
Summary and Conclusions, Research Methods, and Bibliography. Students in the B.S./
M.S. program, must also present their research in the form of a poster presentation 
at the end of their sixth semester (to fulﬁll the requirements of the B.S. degree) and 
an oral presentation at the end of their eighth semester (to fulﬁll the requirements 
of the M.S. degree). Both the poster and oral presentation are coordinated by the 
instructor of CHEM 4900 . For more information, see Academic Regulations, section L, 
Special Academic Arrangements, “Simultaneous Award of the Bachelor's and Master's 
Degrees.”
Credit/D/Fail No chemistry course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward 
the requirements of the major (including substitutions for advanced courses). No 
prerequisites taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the major.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
For the B.A. degree program Students in the B.A. degree program must complete the 
senior seminar CHEM 4000 , in which they prepare a capstone essay on a chemistry-
related topic. The capstone essay is expected to be 15–25 pages in length (double-
spaced, twelve-point font, exclusive of ﬁgures, tables, and bibliography).
For the B.S. degree program Students in the B.S. degree program may fulﬁll the 
senior requirement by completing two terms of the independent research course
CHEM 4900  and writing a  capstone report under the guidance of a faculty member 
that describes their research activities. Alternatively, they may complete the senior 
seminar CHEM 4000 , in which they prepare a capstone essay on a chemistry-related 
topic, and complete one additional course credit of advanced chemistry lecture or 
laboratory course or CHEM 4900 . The capstone report or essay is expected to be 15–
25 pages in length (double-spaced, twelve-point font, exclusive of ﬁgures, tables, and 196            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
bibliography). All students performing research also must present their work in the 
form of an oral or poster presentation as coordinated by the instructor of CHEM 4900 .
For the B.S. degree program with an intensive major Students in the B.S. degree 
program with an intensive major fulﬁll the senior requirement by completing two terms 
of the independent research course CHEM 4900  and writing a  capstone report of 15–
25 pages in length (double-spaced, twelve-point font, exclusive of ﬁgures, tables, and 
bibliography) under the guidance of a faculty member that describes their research 
activities. Students in the intensive major program also must present their work in the 
form of an oral or poster presentation as coordinated by the instructor of CHEM 4900 .
Advising
Majors are encouraged to begin their programs in the ﬁrst year to provide the greatest 
ﬂexibility in scheduling. It is possible, however, to complete the B.S. in as few as six 
terms if a student has advanced placement. One sample B.S. program follows, but 
many others are possible:
First-Year Sophomore Junior Senior
CHEM 1610, 1650, 
1340L, 1360L, math 
prereqCHEM 2200, 2210, 
2520, 2220L, 2230L, 
physics prereqCHEM 3320, 3330, 
3300L, 2510L, 1 elective 
(1 credit)2 terms of 
CHEM 4900, 2 
electives (2 credits)
Substitutions for required courses Up to two credits of advanced science courses 
outside Chemistry may be counted as electives, with the written approval of the 
DUS. CHEM 4900  may not in any circumstance be substituted for any of the 
laboratory requirements. The graduate courses CHEM 5620L , 5640L, and 5650L may 
not be counted toward any requirement of the major.
Programs of study with special emphasis The ﬂexibility of the degree requirements 
makes it possible for a student's program of study to emphasize a particular area of 
specialization in chemistry. For example, a program specializing in chemical biology 
may include CHEM 4190  and biochemistry electives such as MB&B 3000  or 3010. An 
inorganic chemistry specialization could include CHEM 4020  and 4030. A program 
with emphasis in physical chemistry and chemical physics would have electives such 
as CHEM 4660 , 4720, or 4960. Students interested in synthetic organic chemistry 
could complete electives such as CHEM 4160 , 4230, or CHEM 5280 . An emphasis in 
biophysical chemistry includes a course in either chemical biology or biochemistry, as 
well as electives chosen from graduate courses in biophysics or biochemistry. Students 
may design programs with other areas of emphasis in consultation with the DUS. For a 
list of graduate courses appropriate for a particular specialization, consult the DUS.
Approval of major programs of study All Chemistry majors in their sophomore, junior, 
and senior years must have their programs approved by the DUS. A program tailored 
to each student's goals is created and recorded on a Chemistry Course of Study (COS) 
form and submitted to chemistry.dus@yale.edu.
Study Abroad
Chemistry majors wishing to study abroad typically ﬁnd their course of study easier 
to schedule if the semester abroad is a spring term. Students studying abroad in the 
spring term of their junior year are required to obtain approval for the project that will 
fulﬁll their senior requirement before the end of the prior term. For general information Chemistry         197
on the Year or Term Abroad, see Academic Regulations, section K, Special Academic 
Programs, “Year or Term Abroad.”
Unique to the Major
Special restrictions on lecture courses For the general, organic, or physical chemistry 
sequences, CHEM 1610  and 1650; CHEM 1740  or 2200 and CHEM 1750 , 2210, or
CHEM 2300 ; and CHEM 3320  or CHEM 3280  and 3330, completion of the ﬁrst 
term with a passing grade is a prerequisite for registration in the subsequent term. 
Completion of CHEM 1700  with a passing grade is a prerequisite for registration in
CHEM 2200 .
Students receive credit for only one chemistry sequence of any given type. For 
example, a student who has completed CHEM 1700  may not subsequently enroll in
CHEM 1610  or CHEM 1650 ; a student who has completed CHEM 1740  and 1750 may 
not subsequently enroll in CHEM 2200 , 2210, or CHEM 2300 . Similarly, students 
may not enroll in a course (typically of lower number) that is a prerequisite to a 
course they already have taken. For example, a student who has completed an organic 
chemistry laboratory cannot subsequently enroll in a general chemistry laboratory.
Special restrictions on laboratory courses Although the department does not 
recommend it, chemistry courses may be taken without the accompanying laboratory. 
However, the appropriate lecture course is a prerequisite or corequisite for each 
laboratory course. Students dropping the lecture course corequisite with a laboratory 
must also drop the laboratory course.
