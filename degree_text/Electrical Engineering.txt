The Electrical Engineering (EE) program at Yale College is designed to equip students 
with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in today's rapidly evolving technological 
landscape. Our undergraduate program broadly encompasses disciplines such as 
microelectronics, photonics, energy, semiconductor technology, computer engineering, 
signal and information processing, decision and control systems, and communications. 
Students engage in hands-on projects and experimental design, honing their ability 
to analyze complex problems and communicate their ﬁndings eﬀectively. Whether 
pursuing careers in government, industry, or academia, graduates of our program 
are prepared to make signiﬁcant contributions to society and address pressing global 
challenges.
Three electrical engineering degree programs are oﬀered, as well as a joint degree 
between the electrical engineering and computer science departments.
1. The B.S. in Electrical Engineering, accredited by the Engineering Accreditation 
Commission of ABET, Inc., is the ﬂagship degree program and is the most challenging 
program in electrical engineering. This program is appropriate for highly motivated 
students who are interested in entering the engineering profession, and who wish for a 
ﬂexible enough program to consider a variety of other career paths.
Upon graduation, Yale's B.S. Electrical Engineering (ABET) students are expected 
to achieve “student outcomes” as deﬁned by ABET and the program. The Electrical 
Engineering major produces graduates who demonstrate: (1) an ability to identify, 
formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of 
engineering, science, and mathematics; (2) an ability to apply engineering design to 
produce solutions that meet speciﬁed needs with consideration of public health, safety, 
and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors; 
(3) an ability to communicate eﬀectively with a range of audiences; (4) an ability 
to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and 
make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions 
in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts; (5) an ability to function 
eﬀectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative 
and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives; (6) an 
ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, 
and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions; (7) an ability to acquire and apply 
new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
2. The B.S. in Engineering Sciences (Electrical) provides similar technical exposure 
and equivalent rigor as the ABET program, while retaining the ﬂexibility for students 
to take a broader range of courses than those mandated by the ABET curriculum. The 
B.S. in Engineering Sciences (Electrical) is suitable for careers in technology and is a 
popular choice for those choosing academic, industrial, or entrepreneurial career paths.
3. The B.A. in Engineering Sciences (Electrical) is suitable for careers outside of 
technology, including managerial, ﬁnancial, and entrepreneurial career options.268            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
4. The fourth program is a joint B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,
which oﬀers a unique blend of electrical engineering and computer science courses that 
retains the rigor of both ﬁelds. This degree is a popular choice for those interested in 
information technology careers.
The program's educational objectives prepare students for four potential paths. An 
academic path qualiﬁes graduates to enter a top-tier graduate program conducting 
research with broad applications or signiﬁcant consequences, and eventually to teach at 
an academic or research institution. Graduates following an industrial path can enter 
a technical path or a managerial path. An entrepreneurial path allows graduates to 
bring broad knowledge to a startup company, which can deliver a product or service 
that meets societal needs. Graduates who elect a nontraditional engineering path 
might complete a professional program in business, law, or medicine, for which their 
engineering knowledge will be valuable.
Prerequisites 
All three engineering degree programs require MATH 1120  and MATH 1150  if 
applicable, ENAS 1510 or MATH 1200  or higher, ENAS 1300 (CPSC 1001  does not 
fulﬁll this requirement), and PHYS 1800, 1810 or higher (PHYS 1700, 1710 is acceptable 
for the B.A. degree). Acceleration credits awarded on entrance can be used to satisfy 
the MATH 1120  and 1150 requirements. Students whose preparation exceeds the level 
of ENAS 1510 or MATH 1200  are asked to take a higher-level mathematics course 
instead, such as MATH 2220 , MATH 2250 , MATH 2260 , MATH 2550 , or MATH 2560 . 
Similarly, students whose preparation at entrance exceeds the level of PHYS 1800,
1810 are asked to take higher-level physics courses instead, such as PHYS 2000, 2010. 
Students whose programming skills exceed the level of ENAS 1300 are asked to take 
a more advanced programming course instead, such as CPSC 2010 ; consult with the 
director of undergraduate studies (DUS).
Prerequisites taken Credit/D/Fail may not be counted toward the requirements of the 
major.
Requirements of the Major
Because the introductory courses are common to all three degree programs, students 
do not usually need to make a ﬁnal degree choice before the junior year. Each student's 
program must be approved by the DUS.
B.S. degree program in Electrical Engineering/uni2002The ABET-accredited B.S. in Electrical 
Engineering requires, beyond the prerequisites, four term courses in mathematics and 
science and thirteen term courses covering topics in engineering. These courses include:
1.Mathematics and basic science (four term courses): ENAS 1940; MATH 2220  or
MATH 2250  or MATH 2260 ; APHY 3220  or equivalent; S&DS 2380 , or S&DS 2410 , 
or equivalent.
2.Electrical engineering and related subjects (thirteen term courses):
ECE 2000 , 2011, 2020, 2031, 3101, 3200, 3250, 3481, and 4811 (the ABET 
design project senior requirement); and four engineering electives, at least 
three of which should be at the 4000 level. CPSC 3650  or CPSC 3660 ,
MENG 3020L , MENG 4050 , MENG 4673 , BENG 4611 , PHYS 4300, APHY 4580 , 
and all 4000-level computer science courses qualify as ABET electives. One Electrical Engineering          269
of ECE 4680  or ECE 4691 , Advanced Special Projects, also qualify as a 4000-level 
elective.
The introductory engineering courses are designed such that they may be taken 
concurrently in the sophomore year; for example, in the fall term students may 
take ECE 2000  and ECE 2020 , followed by ECE 2011 and ECE 2031 in the spring 
term. These courses may be taken in any order, with the exception of ECE 2031, 
which requires ECE 2000  as a prerequisite. In this case, it would be helpful to 
take ENAS 1940 and/or ENAS 1300 in the ﬁrst year.
A sample ABET-accredited B.S. degree schedule for students who have taken the 
equivalent of one year of calculus in high school (and thus are not required to 
take MATH 1120  and MATH 1150 ) could include:
First Year: ECE 2000 , ECE 2011, ENAS 1510, PHYS 1800, and PHYS 1810
Sophomore: ECE 2020 , ECE 2031, ENAS 1300, ENAS 1940, and MATH 2220
Junior: ECE 3101, ECE 3200 , ECE 3250, ECE 3481, S&DS 2380 , and 1 elective
Senior: APHY 3220 , ECE 4811, and 3 electives
A sample schedule for students who enter into the ABET-accredited B.S. major at the 
sophomore year could include:
First Year: ENAS 1510, ENAS 1300, ENAS 1940, PHYS 1800, and PHYS 1810
Sophomore: ECE 2000 , ECE 2011, ECE 2020 , ECE 2031, and MATH 2220
Junior: ECE 3101, ECE 3200 , ECE 3250, ECE 3481, S&DS 2380 , and 1 elective
Senior: APHY 3220 , ECE 4811, and 3 electives
A sample schedule for students who enter into the ABET-accredited B.S. major in the 
ﬁrst year (and are required to take MATH 1120  and MATH 1150 ) and only seek to fulﬁll 
basic distribution requirements with no engineering courses, could be:
First Year: MATH 1120 , MATH 1150 , PHYS 1800, PHYS 1810, and ENAS 1300
Sophomore: ENAS 1510, ECE 2000 , ECE 2011, ECE 2020 , ECE 2031, and MATH 2220
Junior: ENAS 1940, ECE 3101, ECE 3200 , ECE 3250, ECE 3481, and S&DS 2380
Senior: APHY 3220 , ECE 4811, and 4 electives
B.S. degree program in Engineering Sciences (Electrical)/uni2002This program requires 
fewer technical courses and allows more freedom for work in technical areas outside the 
traditional electrical engineering disciplines (e.g., biomedical engineering, mechanical 
engineering, physics, etc.). It requires thirteen technical term courses beyond the 
prerequisites, speciﬁcally: MATH 2220  or MATH 2250  or MATH 2260 ; ENAS 1940;
ECE 2000 , 2011, 2020, 2031; ECE 4710 and/or 4721 (the senior requirement), or 
with permission of the instructor and the DUS, ECE 4811; and ﬁve or six electives 
(depending on senior requirement) approved by the DUS, at least three of which must 
be at the 4000 level. All electives listed for the ABET-accredited B.S. major qualify as 
electives for this degree.
For students who have taken the equivalent of one year of calculus in high school (and 
thus are not required to take MATH 1120  and MATH 1150 ), a sample schedule for the 
B.S. degree in Engineering Science (Electrical) could be:
First Year: ECE 2000 , ECE 2000 , ENAS 1510, PHYS 1800, and PHYS 1810
Sophomore: ECE 2020 , ECE 2031, ENAS 1300, ENAS 1940, and MATH 2220270            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
Junior: 3 electives
Senior: ECE 4710 and/or 4721, and two or three electives depending on the senior 
project
The B.S. degree in Engineering Sciences (Electrical) requires fewer speciﬁc courses and 
4 fewer courses overall than the ABET-accredited degree. Any of the courses required 
for the ABET-accredited major qualify as electives for this degree, as well as other 
courses with substantial electrical engineering context, subject to the approval of the 
DUS. For students entering the major during the sophomore year, or those who need 
introductory calculus in their ﬁrst year, sample schedules are similar to those described 
for the ABET-accredited degree program, with the diﬀerences in the B.S. Engineering 
Scie
nces (Electrical) degree applied.
The ﬂexibility during the junior and senior years in the schedule above is often used to 
accommodate a second major, such as Economics, Applied Physics, Computer Science, 
P
hysics, or Mechanical Engineering.
B
.A. degree program in Engineering Sciences (Electrical) This program is appropriate 
for those planning a career in ﬁelds such as business, law, or medicine where scientiﬁc 
and technical knowledge is likely to be useful. It requires eight technical term courses 
beyond the prerequisites, speciﬁcally: MATH 2220, MATH 2250, MATH 2260 or 
ENAS 1940; ECE 2000, 2011, 2020, and 4710 and/or 4721 (the senior requirement); and 
two (or three) approved electives.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No courses, including prerequisites, taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied 
toward the requirements of the major. 
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement 
A research or design project carried out in the senior year is required in all three 
programs and must be approved by the DUS. Students take ECE 4710 and/or 4721, or 
ECE 4811, present a written report, and make an oral presentation. ECE 4811 is required 
for students earning the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering (ABET). Students 
taking both ECE 4710 and 4721, Senior Advanced Special Projects, may count one as an 
elective. Arrangements to undertake a project in fulﬁllment of the senior requirement 
must be made by the end of the course selection period in the term in which the student 
will enroll in the course; by this date, a prospectus approved by the intended faculty 
adviser must be submitted to the DUS.
Advising and Approval of Programs
All Electrical Engineering and Engineering Sciences majors must have their programs 
approved by the DUS. Arrangements to take ECE 4710, 4721, or ECE 4811 are strongly 
suggested to be made during the term preceding enrollment in the course. Independent 
research courses (ECE 4680 or ECE 4691) are graded on a Pass/Fail basis, and one (1) 
can be counted toward the requirements of the major.Electrical Engineering         271
