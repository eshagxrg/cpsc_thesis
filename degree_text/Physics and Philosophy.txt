Physics and Philosophy
Directors of undergraduate studies: David Poland (david.poland@yale.edu ) 
(Physics), Daniel Greco (daniel.greco@yale.edu ) (Philosophy)
Prerequisites
Prospective majors in Physics and Philosophy are advised to begin taking the 
prerequisites during their ﬁrst year, and to take at least two of the required philosophy 
courses by the end of their sophomore year. Prerequisites for this major are as follows: 
mathematics through calculus at the level of MATH 1200; any introductory physics 
lecture sequence PHYS 1700, 1710 or higher; PHYS 1650L and 1660L, or PHYS 2050L.
Requirements of the Major
Students are held to the requirements that were in place when they declared their 
major. However, with approval from the DUS, the following requirements, updated for 
the academic year 2025-2026, may be fulﬁlled by students who declared the major in a 
prior term.
Beyond the prerequisites, students take ﬁfteen courses for fourteen and a half course 
credits, including the senior requirement. The laboratory course PHYS 2060L and 
seven advanced courses in physics approved by the director of undergraduate studies 
(DUS) numbered 3000 or higher are required, including PHYS 4000 or equivalent, 
and either PHYS 4390 or 4400. Six courses in Philosophy or in History of Science, 
Medicine, and Public Health are required, including PHIL 1125 and PHIL 1126, one 
course in logic above the introductory level, and a philosophy seminar selected with the 
approval of the DUSs.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002At most, one course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the 
major, with permission of the DUSs. Physics courses must be taken for a letter grade to 
count towards the major, including prerequisites.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
te
rm-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement 
B.S. degree program/uni2002Seniors must complete PHYS 4710 and/or 4720, only one of 
which may count toward the eight required physics courses.
B.A. degree program/uni2002Seniors must complete one of the following: (1) PHIL 4490 or 
PHIL 4491 (senior essay); (2) PHIL 4480 (tutorial) on an appropriate subject; (3) an 
appropriate philosophy seminar with the approval of the DUS in Philosophy.
