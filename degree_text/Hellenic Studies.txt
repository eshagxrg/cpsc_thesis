Hellenic Studies Program
Hellenic Studies is a program of the European Studies Council. The core of the 
program is the teaching of modern Greek, supplemented with other courses and 
events related to the study of post-antiquity Greece, as well as the society and 
culture of modern Greece and its interaction with the rest of Europe and the world. 
Related courses can be found in the listings of Anthropology, History, History of Art, 
Comparative Literature, Political Science, Religious Studies, and Russian and East 
European Studies. A major in Ancient and Modern Greek is described under Classics. 
Students who have an interest in post-antiquity Greek language, society, or culture are 
advised to consult with the director of undergraduate studies.
