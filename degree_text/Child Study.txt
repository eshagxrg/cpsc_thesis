brings together multiple disciplines to further the understanding of the problems of 
children and families. Among the many disciplines are child psychiatry, pediatrics, 
genetics, neurobiology, epidemiology, psychology, nursing, social work, and social 
policy. The mission of the Yale Child Study Center is to improve the mental health of 
children and families, advance understanding of their psychological and developmental 
needs, and treat and prevent childhood mental illness through the integration of 
research, clinical practice, and professional training. The Child Study Center is unique 
in its scope of research, clinical services, training programs, policy work, and its local, 
state, national, and international collaborations. The strengths of the Center are 
reﬂected in the breadth and integrative nature of research, clinical services and training.
