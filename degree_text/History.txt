The History major is for students who understand that shaping the future requires 
knowing the past. History courses explore many centuries of human experimentation 
and ingenuity, from the global to the individual scale. History majors learn to be 
eﬀective storytellers and analysts, and to craft arguments that speak to broad audiences. 
They make extensive use of Yale’s vast library resources to create pioneering original 
research projects. Students of history learn to think about politics and government, 
sexuality, the economy, cultural and intellectual life, war and society, and other themes 
in broadly humanistic—rather than narrowly technocratic—ways.
History is one of Yale College’s most popular and intellectually diverse majors, 
encompassing nearly every region and time period of the global past. The study of 
history is excellent preparation for careers in many ﬁelds, including law, journalism, 
business and ﬁnance, education, politics and public policy, social activism, and the arts.
Course Numbering
History undergraduate courses are numbered 0000–4999. The ﬁrst digit indicates the 
course’s level; courses that begin with 0 (zero) are ﬁrst-year seminars, with enrollment 
limited to eighteen. Courses that begin with the number 1 are lectures. Courses that 
begin with the number 2 are either (a) more advanced lectures, some of which might 
include WR credit (b) seminars cross-listed with other departments, or (c) reading 
or historiography focused seminars that do not require substantial work with primary 
sources. Courses that begin with the number 3 are departmental seminars; these 
courses combine reading, research, and writing and are intended to prepare students for 
their Senior Essay. All departmental seminars prioritize History major enrollment and 
are available for preregistration by History majors. Departmental seminars are capped 
at ﬁfteen students; many carry WR credit. Courses that begin with the number 4 are 
senior requirement courses and independent studies.
Each course’s second digit indicates its region: x1xx courses explore the history of 
the United States or Canada; x2xx, Europe, Russia, and Britain; x3xx Africa (Sub-
Saharan), x4xx Asia, x5xx Latin America, and x6xx Middle East/North Africa. x7xx 
courses address comparative, transnational, or global topics. Thus, 16xx indicates a 
lecture on the Middle East/North Africa, 31xx is a departmental seminar on the United 
States or Canada, and so on.
Prerequisite
The prerequisite for the major is two term courses in History. Courses completed in 
fulﬁllment of the prerequisite may be applied toward the requirements of the major. 
(Directed Studies history and philosophy courses count automatically as history 
prerequisites.)
Requirements of the Major
Students are held to the requirements in place when they declared 
their major. However, with approval from the DUS, the following requirements, 328            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
updated for the academic year 2025-2026, may be fulﬁlled by students who declared the 
major in a prior term.
See Links to the attributes indicating courses approved for the History 
major requirements.
Twelve term courses in History are required, including prerequisites and the senior 
requirement. Upon declaration, all History majors select either the global or the 
specialist concentration. The global concentration is designed for students seeking a 
broad understanding of major trends in the history of human societies throughout 
the world. The specialist concentration is for students seeking to focus in a particular 
geographic region, such as the United States, or in a thematic pathway, such as empires 
and colonialism. Majors may change concentrations until the end of the course selection 
period in the second term of the junior year.
The global concentration  requires one course in ﬁve of the six diﬀerent geographic regions 
(see below). Students must also take two preindustrial courses, covering material 
before the mid-19th century (and no later than 1900), and two 3000-level departmental 
seminars.
The specialist concentration requires at least ﬁve (and up to eight) courses in a particular 
geographic region or in a thematic pathway (see list below). Courses appropriate 
for each region and pathway are listed on the department website. Students must 
also take a
t least two courses outside their area of specialization, and their overall 
coursework must include at least three geographic regions. Like students in the global 
concentration, students in the specialist concentration must take two preindustrial 
courses, and at least two 3000-level departmental seminars. Students in the specialist 
concentration may design an area of specialization with the approval of a faculty adviser 
and the DUS.
Regions: Africa (Sub-Saharan), Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East/North 
Africa, and United States/Canada.
Pathways: cultural history; empires and colonialism; environmental history; ideas and 
intellectuals; international and diplomatic history (formerly international history); 
politics, law, and government (formerly politics and law); race, gender, and sexuality; 
religion in context; science, technology, and medicine; social change and social 
movements; war and society; the world economy
Students in either concentration may count the same courses toward geographical, 
preindustrial, and seminar requirements. For instance, a departmental seminar on 
premodern Japan simultaneously fulﬁlls the preindustrial, departmental seminar, and 
Asia geographical requirements.
Departmental seminars All students who declare the History major are entitled to 
preregister for 3000-level departmental seminars. Many seminars are popular and ﬁll 
up quickly. Students may use their preregistration privileges at any time after declaring 
the major, in their sophomore, junior, or senior years. Sophomores contemplating 
study abroad are urged to consider taking at least one seminar in the sophomore year. 
Residential College Seminars, study abroad courses, 2000-level seminars and courses in 
other departments that count toward the History major do not fulﬁll the departmental 
seminar requirement, although they can satisfy other requirements (preindustrial, History         329
region, pathway, etc.) Students cannot preregister for 2000-level seminars during 
departmental preregistration.
Distinction in the major Students who receive an A or A– on the two-term senior essay 
and who receive the requisite grades in their remaining coursework are awarded 
Distinction in the Major. (See The Undergraduate Curriculum, Honors.) Students who 
do not complete the two-term senior essay are not eligible for Distinction.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002History majors may count up to two lecture courses or non-3000 
seminars taken Cr/D/F toward the requirements of the major. Departmental seminars 
may not be taken Cr/D/F. (Writers of one-term senior essays may opt to take their 11th 
term course Cr/D/F. Please see one-term senior essay below.)
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
Students in the History major are not passive consumers of historical knowledge: 
they create original works of history themselves. As seniors, History majors complete 
a work of original research in close consultation with a faculty adviser. The range of 
acceptable topics and methodological approaches is wide. The aim is to take on study of 
a signiﬁcant historical subject through research in accessible primary source materials.
Most students choose to write a two-term independent senior essay, for two course 
credits toward the major. The two-term essay is required to earn Distinction in the 
Major. A smaller number of students choose to write an independent one-term senior 
essay, for one course credit toward the major.
The one-term senior essay History majors may choose to write a one-term 
independent senior essay during the fall term under the guidance of a faculty adviser. 
However, students who choose the one-term option are not eligible for Distinction in 
the Major or history prizes. The one-term essay is a substantial research paper (roughly 
half the length of the two-term senior essay) based on primary sources, along with a 
bibliographic essay. Seniors receive course credit for their senior essays by enrolling in 
HIST 4997 during the ﬁrst-semester of their senior year.  In rare circumstances, with 
permission of the adviser and senior essay director, a student enrolled in HIST 4997 
during the ﬁrst term may withdraw from the course in accordance with Yale College 
regulations on course withdrawal and enroll in HIST 4997 during the second term. 
Even more rarely, students might register for HIST 4997 during their second term, 
with prior arrangement with both their advisor and the Senior Essay director. 
Additional details about the senior essay are provided in the Senior Essay Handbook, 
available on the History website. Students writing a one-term essay must enroll in one 
additional term course, of any sort, for a total of 12 History credits (11 courses + one-
term essay). This additional course can be taken Cr/D/F, bringing the potential total to 
three such Cr/D/F courses, unless the additional course is a departmental seminar.
The two-term senior essay History majors seeking to earn Distinction in the Major 
must complete a two-term independent senior essay under the guidance of a faculty 
adviser. The typical senior essay is 40–50 pages (no more than 12,500 words), plus 
a bibliography and bibliographical essay. Seniors receive course credit for their 330            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
departmental essays by enrolling in HIST 4995 (ﬁrst term of senior year) and
HIST 4996 (second term of senior year). The grade for the ﬁnal essay, determined by 
an outside reader in consultation with the faculty adviser, is applied retroactively to 
both terms. Additional details about the senior essay are provided in the Senior Essay 
Handbook, available on the History website. History majors graduating in December 
may begin their two-term senior essay in the spring term and complete the senior essay 
during fall term.
Additional option for the senior essay Some students embark on the two-term essay 
but discover that their choice is not a good ﬁt. Students who enroll in HIST 4995 
during the ﬁrst term may opt out in consultation with their faculty adviser and the 
senior essay director. This decision must be made in accordance with Yale College 
regulations on course withdrawal . Instead, the student will enroll in HIST 4997 in the 
spring term to write a one-term senior essay. Students who opt out will not be eligible 
for Distinction in the Major or History prizes. Additional details about the senior essay 
are provided in the Senior Essay Handbook, available on the History website.
Alternative senior essay option In addition to the one-semester and two-semester 
essay, the department will occasionally accept an alternative senior project that is not 
an extended written essay, with the approval of the Senior Essay Director, an advisor 
and a second reader. Such alternatives must be based on extensive research with 
primary and secondary sources. Students completing such projects must consult with 
experts in their chosen medium, in addition to the faculty members delineated above. 
Alternative projects will require a proposal (due by the end of the ﬁrst month of the 
student’s senior year) and a substantial piece of historical writing (~5,000 words) 
to complement the alternative project. Both components will be considered when 
assessing and grading the project. These will be two-semester projects only and will be 
eligible for distinction in the major. Seniors receive course credit for their departmental 
projects by enrolling in HIST 4995 (ﬁrst term of senior year) and HIST 4996 (second 
term of senior year).
Advising  All students who declare the History major are assigned an adviser from 
among the departmental faculty. The adviser is available throughout the year for 
consultation about courses and the major. Students in the global concentration 
are assigned an adviser from the general History faculty. Students may request a 
speciﬁc adviser in consultation with the DUS, though the department cannot always 
accommodate such requests. In addition, a small group of advanced undergraduate 
students serve as peer advisors and are available to assist students in navigating the 
major.
Course substitution History majors are permitted to include up to two courses taught 
outside the department toward fulﬁllment of the major, with the approval of the DUS. 
Non-departmental courses may fulﬁll geographic, region/pathway, and preindustrial 
distribution requirements. They may not fulﬁll Departmental Seminar or senior 
requirements.
Combined B.A./M.A. degree program Exceptionally able and well-prepared students 
may complete a course of study leading to the simultaneous award of the B.A. and 
M.A. degrees after eight terms of enrollment. See Academic Regulations, section L, 
Special Academic Arrangements, “Simultaneous Award of the Bachelor’s and Master’sHistory         331
Degrees.” Interested students should consult the DUS prior to the sixth term of 
enrollment for speciﬁc requirements in History.
