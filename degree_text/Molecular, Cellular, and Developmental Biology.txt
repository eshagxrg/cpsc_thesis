The science of biology is extremely broad, ranging across the domains of molecules, 
cells, tissues and organs, organisms, and ecosystems. Moreover, biology explores 
questions of evolutionary history and the processes of evolutionary change, as well 
as the mechanisms by which cells, organisms, and ecosystems function. Students 
majoring in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology receive a thorough yet 
varied liberal education and preparation for professional careers in a diverse array of 
ﬁelds. Practical applications of biology include the development of biologicals and 
pharmaceuticals, the practice of medicine, and the pursuit of the scientiﬁc bases for 
understanding the development and function of biological systems.
Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (MCDB) o ﬀers programs for 
students wishing to concentrate on molecular and cellular biology and genetics, with 
applications to problems in cell and developmental biology, neurobiology, and various 
aspects of quantitative biology. Interdisciplinary opportunities are available within the 
major in the Biotechnology, Neurobiology, and Quantitative Biology concentrations 
(previously tracks).
The MCDB major oﬀers many opportunities for independent laboratory research. With 
approv
al, research can be conducted under the supervision of faculty members in any 
Yale department.
Prerequisites
Students are held to the prerequisite requirements in place when they 
declared their major. However, with approval from the DUS and/or course 
instructors, the following prerequisite Biology requirements, updated for the academic 
year 2025–2026, may be fulﬁlled by students who declared the major in a prior term. 
M
ost but not all of the MCDB courses require prior preparation in biological science. 
First years are suggested to take BIOL 1010, BIOL 1020, BIOL 1030, and BIOL 1040. 
Students who do not complete this introductory BIOL sequence take one or two 
(depending on the number of BIOL 1010-1040 modules completed) advanced lecture 
or seminar courses (MCDB 2000 level or above or equivalent level in some related 
departments) to fulﬁll the biology prerequisite. Contact the director of undergraduate 
studies (DUS) for more information. All majors must also complete a course in 
mathematics numbered MATH 1150 or higher or a statistics course (S&DS 1000, 1080, 
1090, 2380), and other statistic courses taken at Yale with approval from the DUS.
For the B.A. degree, students must take a two-term lecture sequence in chemistry, 
usually in their ﬁrst year, and a term course in physics numbered PHYS 1700 or higher 
usually in their junior year.
For the B.S. degree, students must take a two-term lecture sequence in chemistry, with 
associated laboratories usually in their ﬁrst year; a term course in organic chemistry 382            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
with its associated laboratory usually in their sophomore year; and two term courses in 
physics numbered PHYS 1700 or higher usually in their junior year.
Placement Procedures
Placement in MCDB courses is determined by examinations administered at Yale or by 
permission of the DUS. A student may place out of one or more courses in the BIOL 
1010–1040 sequence. One or more of these foundational biology courses (or equivalent 
performance on the corresponding biological sciences placement examination) may be 
explicitly required as prerequisites for upper-level MCDB courses. Students who do not 
complete the introductory BIOL sequence take one or two (depending on the number 
of BIOL 1010-1040 modules completed) advanced lecture or seminar courses (MCDB 
2000 level or above or equivalent level in some related departments) to complete the 
biology prerequisite.
Placement in chemistry courses is arranged by the Department of Chemistry. Because 
required chemistry courses are prerequisite to several MCDB courses, students 
are strongly encouraged to take general and organic chemistry in the ﬁrst and/or 
sophomore years. Students who place out of general chemistry may want to consider 
taking organic chemistry during the ﬁrst year. Finishing the prerequisites early allows 
for a more ﬂexible program in later years.
Acceleration credit awarded in chemistry, mathematics, or physics, or completion 
of advanced courses in those subjects, is accepted in place of the corresponding 
prerequisites for the MCDB major. Students who have mathematics preparation 
equivalent to MATH 1150 or higher are encouraged to take additional mathematics 
courses, such as MATH 1200, 1210, 2220, or 2250, or ENAS 1510 or 1940. Students in 
the B.A. degree program who have satisﬁed one or more prerequisites with advanced 
placement must still complete three term courses in chemistry and physics at Yale, 
including at least one from each department.
Requirements of  the  Major
B.A. degree program/uni2002The B.A. degree requires a minimum of ﬁve and one-half course 
credits beyond the prerequisites (the same course cannot be used to satisfy both a 
prerequisite and a core or elective requirement), including ﬁve lecture or seminar 
courses and one laboratory, as follows:
1.Two cor
e courses/uni2002selected from MCDB 2000, 2020, 2050, 2100, 2900, 3000 (or
MB&B 3000 )
2.Two general electives selected from MCDB courses numbered 2500 or above, or
two additional core courses from the list above. Two laboratory courses, either
MCDB 3420L  and 3430L or MCDB 3440L  and 3450L, can be paired for a single
elective credit. If used as an elective, these laboratories cannot also fulﬁll the
laboratory requirement
3.One special elective selected from MCDB courses numbered 3500 or higher
4.One laboratory from the biological sciences. Laboratories may be selected from
MCDB, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, or Biomedical Engineering, or, with
permission of the DUS, from Anthropology or Ecology & Evolutionary Biology
5.The senior requirement (senior essay option does not carry course credit)Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology         383
B.S. degree program/uni2002 The B.S. degree requires a minimum of nine course credits 
beyond the prerequisites (the same course cannot be used to satisfy both a prerequisite 
and a core or elective requirement), including eight lecture or seminar courses and two 
laboratories, as follows:
1.Three core courses/uni2002selected from MCDB 2000 , 2020, 2050, 2100, 2900, 3000 (or
MB&B 3000 )
2.Two general electives selected from MCDB courses numbered 2500 or above.
Additional core courses from the list above, a second term of organic chemistry,
and a course in statistics may be used as general electives. Two laboratory courses,
either MCDB 3420L  and 3430L or MCDB 3440L  and 3450L, can be paired for a
single elective credit. If used as an elective, these laboratories cannot also fulﬁll the
laboratory requirement
3.One special elective from MCDB courses numbered 3500 or higher
4.Two laboratories from MCDB
5.The senior requirement (2 course credits), described below
The B.S. degree program, intensive major /uni2002Requirements for the B.S. degree 
program, intensive major, are the same as those for the B.S. degree except for the 
senior requirement (see below). This degree requires eleven course credits beyond the 
prerequisites (the same course cannot be used to satisfy both a prerequisite and a core 
or elective requirement), including 6 courses, 2 half-credit labs, and 2 senior research 
courses, each worth two credits.
Independent research courses before senior year/uni2002The only independent research 
course available to students prior to the senior year is MCDB 4740. This course is 
graded Pass/Fail and contributes to the thirty-six course credits required for the 
bachelor's degree, but it does not substitute for any MCDB major requirement, 
including the senior requirement. No independent research course satisﬁes a lab 
requirement for the MCDB major.
Independent research courses during senior year/uni2002The research courses MCDB 4750, 
4850, 4860, and MCDB 4950, 4960 exist primarily to fulﬁll the senior requirement, 
and do not satisfy any other requirement for the major. Note that Yale College limits 
the number of independent study or independent research courses that students may 
take; see Academic Regulations, section C, Course Credits and Course Loads. Any 
independent study course, regardless of its number, is included in the total. No 
independent research course satisﬁes a lab requirement for the MCDB major.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of the major, including prerequisites.
Outside credit  Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement 
In addition to the course requirements described above, all students must satisfy a 
senior requirement undertaken during the senior year. A booklet listing the senior 
requirements of each concentration and degree is available in the office of the DUS 384            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
(111 YSC). All students must ﬁll out a checklist of requirements and go over it with 
the MCDB undergraduate registrar, (mcdb.ureg@yale.edu) by the spring term of the 
junior year.
B.A. degree program/uni2002For the B.A. degree, the senior requirement can be met either 
by submitting a senior essay of 15–20 pages evaluating current research in a ﬁeld of 
biology, or by successful completion of one term of individual research (MCDB 4750 ). 
A senior choosing to fulﬁll the requirement with a senior essay must consult with a 
faculty adviser on the scope and literature of the topic and submit the adviser's written 
approval to the DUS no later than the course selection period of the term in which the 
paper is due. The senior essay may be related to the subject matter of a course, but the 
essay is a separate departmental requirement in addition to any work done in a course 
and does not count toward the grade in any course. The senior essay must be completed 
and submitted to the oﬃce of the DUS by the last day of classes. Students electing this 
option should obtain an approval form from the oﬃce of the DUS. Students who select 
this option should be aware it carries no credit.
B.S. degree program/uni2002For the B.S. degree, the senior requirement is usually fulﬁlled 
by completing a yearlong research course, MCDB 4850 , 4860. The senior requirement 
must be completed during the senior year. Yale College does not grant academic credit 
for summer research unless the student is enrolled in an independent research course in 
Yale Summer Session. Seniors working toward the B.S. degree are expected to spend at 
least ten hours per week in the lab conducting individual research.
B.S. degree program, intensive major/uni2002Requirements for the B.S. degree with an 
intensive major are the same as those for the B.S. degree except that students fulﬁll 
the senior requirement by taking MCDB 4950 , 4960 for four course credits. Seniors 
in the intensive major are expected to spend at least twenty hours per week in the lab 
conducting individual research.
Additional Information And aDvising
The prerequisites for the B.S. degree fulﬁll most of the usual premedical science 
requirements. Students who choose the B.A. degree can also prepare for medical school 
by taking additional premedical courses.
Selection of courses /uni2002A relevant intermediate or advanced course from another 
department in science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics may be accepted as 
an elective with permission of the DUS. Many courses in other departments have 
prerequisites; such prerequisites can be substituted for an upper-level elective with 
permission of the DUS.
Residential College Seminars cannot be substituted for electives and do not count 
toward the requirements of the major. The MCDB major should not be taken as one 
of two majors with Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Ecology and Evolutionary 
Biology, or Neuroscience.
Advising/uni2002First-year students considering a major in Molecular, Cellular, and 
Developmental Biology are invited to consult with the DUS and/or a faculty member 
in MCDB who is a fellow of their residential college. MCDB majors are required to 
meet with the MCDB faculty adviser and the departmental undergraduate registrar
(mcdb.ureg@yale.edu) once per term and prior to registration. For assistance in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology         385
identifying a suitable adviser, students should contact the departmental undergraduate 
registrar. (mcdb.ureg@yale.edu) Students in the Biotechnology, Neurobiology, or 
Quantitative Biology concentrations should consult an adviser for their concentration 
(listed below). Students whose regular adviser is on leave can consult the oﬃce of the 
DUS to arrange for an alternate.

Simultaneous B.S./M.S. degree program/uni2002Exceptionally able and well-prepared 
students may accelerate their professional education by completing a course of study 
leading to the simultaneous award of the B.S. and M.S. degrees after eight terms of 
enrollment. Students may not enroll in Yale College for more than eight terms in 
order to qualify for the simultaneous award of both degrees. It is possible to earn 
both degrees in fewer than eight terms, but not by the use of acceleration credits. The 
requirements are as follows:
1.Candidates must satisfy the Yale College requirements for the B.S. degree. Students 
in the program must complete the core courses for the major and choose their 
4 electives from graduate-level courses. One of the electives must be a graduate 
seminar selected with the approval of the DUS. Grades below B– in graduate 
courses are not accepted.
2.In addition to the courses speciﬁed above, students must complete three terms 
of graduate research courses for six course credits: (1) MCDB 5850 , a two-credit 
course taken in the second term of the junior year. At the start of the course, 
each student forms a committee comprised of the faculty adviser and two faculty 
members that meets to discuss the research project. Two of the members of this 
committee must be members of the MCDB faculty. At the end of the course, the 
student completes a detailed prospectus describing the thesis project and the work 
completed to date. The committee evaluates an oral and written presentation of 
the prospectus and determines whether the student may continue in the combined 
program; (2) MCDB 5950 , 5960, a four-credit, yearlong course that is similar 
to MCDB 4950 , 4960 and is taken during the senior year. During the course, the 
student gives an oral presentation describing the work. At the end of the course, 
the student is expected to present his or her work to the department in the form 
of a poster presentation. In addition, the student is expected to give an oral thesis 
defense, followed by a comprehensive examination of the thesis conducted by the 
thesis committee. Upon successful completion of this examination, as well as all 
other requirements, the student is awarded the combined B.S./M.S. degree.386            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
Students must also satisfy the requirements of Yale College for the simultaneous award 
of the bachelor's and master's degrees, including the following:
1.To be considered for admission to the program, by the end of their ﬁfth term of 
enrollment students must have achieved at least two-thirds A or A– grades in all of 
their courses as well as in all of the courses directly relating to the major, including 
prerequisites.
2.Students must apply in writing to the DUS and obtain departmental approval no 
later than the last day of classes in their ﬁfth term of enrollment in Yale College.
3.Students must have the approval of both the DUS and the director of graduate 
studies to receive graduate credit for the graduate courses they select.
4.Graduate work must not be entirely concentrated in the ﬁnal two terms, and 
students in the program must take at least six term courses outside the department 
during their last four terms at Yale and at least two undergraduate courses during 
their last two terms.
5.Students must earn grades of A in at least two of their graduate-level term courses 
(or in one yearlong course) and have at least a B average in the remaining ones.
For more information, see Academic Regulations, section L, Special Academic 
Arrangements, “Simultaneous Award of the Bachelor's and Master's Degrees.”
Study Abroad
Some programs for study abroad are available to MCDB majors. Approved programs 
can fulﬁll some of the requirements for the major. Interested students should consult 
the DUS and the  Center for International and Professional Experience.
