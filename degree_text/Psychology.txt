Psychology
Director of undergraduate studies: Yarrow Dunham (yarrow.dunham@yale.edu),

Psychology is the scientiﬁc study of the mind, the brain, and human behavior. The 
Psychology department oﬀers coursework and research opportunities in the ﬁelds of 
clinical, cogniti
ve, developmental, neuroscientiﬁc, and social psychology. By studying 
psychology, students better understand human behavior, including who we are, how we 
do the things we do, and how we enhance our lives and society. The Psychology major 
provides a foundation for careers in education and research; law; medicine and public 
health; politics and public policy; and in business ﬁelds such as marketing, ﬁnance, and 
management.
Course Numbering
Courses in the department are organized so that they are best taken in several parallel 
sequences. Courses numbered 1100–1900 and ending in a zero are core survey 
courses that introduce students to major areas of psychology and provide additional 
background for more advanced courses. These courses represent major content 
areas of psychology; students should sample broadly from them before specializing. 
Courses numbered from 2000–2090 focus on statistics. Courses numbered 2100–2990 
teach general methodology or data collection in various areas of psychology. Courses 
numbered from 3000–3990 are more advanced courses in a particular specialization. 
Senior seminars, whose enrollment is limited to no more than twenty students, are 
numbered from 4000–4890. These seminars are best taken once a student has the 
appropriate background. Courses numbered from 4900–4990 are special tutorial 
courses that require permission of the adviser and the director of undergraduate studies 
(DUS).
Prerequisite
PSYC 1100, a general survey course, is a prerequisite to several 1000-level and all 2000-
level and above courses. This prerequisite may alternatively be satisﬁed by a score of 5 
on the Psychology Advanced Placement test or a score of 7 on the IB Psychology exam.
Requirements of the Major
See Links to the attributes indicating courses approved for Psychology 
major requirements.
Standard major The standard major in Psychology for both the B.A. degree program 
and the B.S. degree program requires twelve credits beyond PSYC 1100, including the 
senior requirement. The diﬀerence between the B.A. and the B.S. degree programs is 
the senior r
equirement (see below).
1.Because psychology is so diverse a subject, every student is required to take two
courses from the social science point of view in psychology and two from the 
natural science point of view in psychology. Listed below are examples of courses 
that fulﬁll these requirements. A complete list of courses, updated each term, may  
be found on Yale Course Search (YCS) by searching “Any Course Information 
Attribute.” At least one from each group must be a course designated as Core in 
the course listings and below. Students are expected to take their two core coursesPsychology         427
as earl
y as possible in the major, normally within two terms after declaring their 
major.
     Social science core  (YC PSYC Social Science Core): PSYC 1400 , 1500, 1700
     Social science : Search YCS for courses with the YC PSYC Social Science designation
     Natural science core  (YC PSYC Natural Science Core): PSYC 1300, 1600
     Natural science : Search YCS for courses with the YC PSYC Natural Science 
designation.
2.Because statistical techniques and the mode of reasoning they employ are
fundamental in psychology, a course in statistics is required, preferably prior to the
senior year. A student may take S&DS 1000 or 2300  to satisfy this requirement. A
student who has a score of 5 on the AP Statistics Exam must take S&DS 2300  or
1230 (YData). If approved in advance by the DUS, a second course in statistics or
quantitative methodology that focuses on advanced techniques relevant for research
in psychology can be counted towards the major as a PSYC elective.
3.To ensure some direct experience in collecting and analyzing data, students must
elect at least one research methods course, preferably before the senior year, in
which research is planned and carried out. For students pursuing the BS degree,
this course must be taken prior to the senior year. Courses numbered between
2100–2990 fulﬁll this research methods requirement.
4.Students may, with permission of the DUS, count up to three term courses in
other related departments toward the major. Appropriate courses are rare and only
approved when the course has substantial empirical psychology content. Students
should consult with the DUS in Psychology about selecting outside courses and
should not assume that a course will count prior to that consultation. Getting this
approval in advance is highly recommended.
Students interested in research are encouraged to take an independent study course 
(PSYC 4925 ) as early as the sophomore year. Students may also take PSYC 4950 for 
one-half course credit of independent research per term with prior permission of the 
faculty adviser and the DUS (this course is often taken twice in sequence). To obtain 
permission, follow the instructions on the department website to ﬁll out the enrollment 
survey and then add the class normally, being sure to request instructor permission. 
This process must be completed at least one week before the end of the add/drop 
period for a given semester. These independent study courses are graded P/F. No more 
than a total of three credits from PSYC 4900–4990 combined may count toward the 
major.
Neuroscience concentration/uni2002 Students with a major interest in neuroscience may wish 
to elect the neuroscience concentration. Such students are considered Psychology 
majors for whom the requirements have been modiﬁed to accommodate their 
interests and to reﬂect the multidisciplinary nature of modern neuroscience and 
psychology. Given the broad nature of the ﬁeld of neuroscience, students may 
wish to concentrate their studies in one area of the ﬁeld (e.g., behavioral, cellular 
and molecular, cognitive, aﬀective, social, clinical, or developmental). Interested 
students are encouraged to contact the concentration adviser, Stephanie Lazzaro
(stephanie.lazzaro@yale.edu ). Majors in the neuroscience concentration must check in 428            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
with the concentration adviser at the beginning of each term in their junior and senior 
years.
Requirements for the neuroscience concentration are the same as for the standard 
major, with the additional requirements listed below. A complete list of courses, 
updated each term, may be found on Yale Course Search (YCS) by searching 
“Any 
Course Information Attribute.”
1.Two terms of introductory biology are required for the major,
BIOL 1010 -BIOL 1040 . Students who have scored 5 on the Advanced Placement test
in Biology or scored 7 on the IB Biology exam may place out of these courses.
2.Students must take PSYC 1600 and a data-collection course (YC PSYC NSCI
Track RsrchMthds) chosen from PSYC 2600 , 2538, 2700, 2658  or 2670.
PSYC 2690L , 2760, or MCDB 3200  may substitute for the PSYC 1600  requirement,
or MCDB 3200  and 3210L may substitute for PSYC 2690L  or PSYC 2760, but not
both. If MCDB 3200  is substituted for a Psychology course, it cannot be counted as
one of the two advanced science courses outside the department (see item 4 below).
3.As required for the standard major, students in the neuroscience concentration must
take two social science courses, at least one of which must be designated as Core
in the course listings. Students in the neuroscience concentration must also take
a course from the natural science list in addition to the courses speciﬁed in item 2
above.
4.At least two advanced science courses (YC PSYC NSCI Track Adv Scie) must be
chosen from Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology courses numbered 2000 and above that deal with human
and/or animal biology; recommended courses include MCDB 2000, 2020 , 2050,
2100, 2500, 3000, 3150, 3200, EEB 2220 and 2225. Certain courses outside of
these departments may also meet the advanced science requirement, including
BENG 3200 , BENG 5440 , CPSC 4750, MB&B 3000, 3010, 4200, 4350, 4430, 3520 ,
MATH 2220, MATH 2250 , and MATH 2410 . Other courses may qualify for this
requirement with permission of the neuroscience concentration adviser. Laboratory
courses do not count toward the advanced science requirement. Students should
note that many advanced science courses have prerequisites that must be taken ﬁrst.
Credit/D/Fail /uni2002No more than two courses taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward 
the requirements of the major; no 2000-level course, or course taken to satisfy a 2000-
level requirement (the statistics or research methods requirement), can be taken Credit/
D/Fail and then applied toward the major.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
te
rm-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval. 
Senior Requirement 
Standard major/uni2002Majors are required to earn two course credits from courses numbered 
PSYC 4000–4990. At least one of these courses (excluding PSYC 4925 and PSYC 4950, 
which can only be taken P/F) must be taken during the senior year, for which a student 
must write a substantial ﬁnal paper (a minimum of 5,000 words) and receive a letter 
grade. The B.A. degree is typically awarded to students who conduct a nonempirical 
literature review during senior year. There are no restrictions in the research format Psychology         429
for the B.A. The B.S. degree is awarded to students who conduct empirical research 
through PSYC 4990 during senior year. An empirical research project normally includes 
designing an experiment and collecting and analyzing the data. Students pursuing the 
B.S. degree will want to identify a faculty advisor well in advance of the semester in 
which they intend to complete their senior essay, and they may want to seek research 
experiences with that faculty member prior to the senior year.
Neuroscience concentration/uni2002The senior requirement for the neuroscience 
concentration is the same as for the standard major, except that the two required course 
credits from PSYC 4000–4990 must have neuroscience content (YC PSYC NSCI Track 
Senior Sem designation). Students pursuing the B.S. degree in the concentration must 
carry out a neuroscientiﬁc empirical project in PSYC 4990 and must be supervised 
by a faculty member within the neuroscience area of the Psychology department. 
Students who wish to work with an aﬃliated faculty member studying neuroscience 
outside the department must obtain permission from the neuroscience concentration 
adviser. Students pursuing the B.S. degree will want to identify a faculty advisor well 
in advance of the semester in which they intend to complete their senior essay, and they 
may want to seek research experiences with that faculty member before the senior year.
Distinction in the Major/uni2002To be considered for Distinction in the Major, students must 
submit a senior essay to the Psychology department at least one week before the last day 
of classes in the term when the course used for the senior essay is taken. Senior essays 
that are submitted after the deadline will be subject to grade penalties. Senior essays 
considered for Distinction in the Major are graded by a second reader and the essay 
adviser. Senior essays must be submitted to the department by the deadline.
Advising
Schedules for all majors must be discussed with, and approved by, the DUS or the 
adviser for the neuroscience concentration in Psychology. For questions concerning 
credits for courses taken at other institutions or at Yale but outside the Department 
of Psychology, students should consult with the DUS. For questions concerning 
the neuroscience concentration, students should consult with the adviser for the 
neuroscience concentration in Psychology.
Computer Science and Psychology major/uni2002The interdepartmental major in Computer 
Science and Psychology may be considered by students with interests lying squarely 
between the two disciplines. See Computer Science and Psychology for more 
information.
