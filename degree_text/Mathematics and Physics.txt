Mathematics and Physics
Adviser for the major:  Vincent Moncrief (vincent.moncrief@yale.edu), KT 413, 
432-6930
Directors of undergraduate studies: Sebastian Hurtado-Salazar (Mathematics), 
Miki Havlickova (Mathematics); math.dus@yale.edu; David Poland
(dus.physics@yale.edu) (Physics)
The major in Mathematics and Physics allows students to explore the productive 
interaction between the two subjects more extensively than either individual major.
Prerequisites
Students are held to the prerequisites that were in place when they declared their 
major. However, with approval from the DUS, the following requirements, updated for 
the academic year 2025–2026, may be fulﬁlled by students who declared the major in a 
prior term.
Prerequisites to the major include MATH 1200, an introductory physics lecture 
sequence numbered PHYS 1800, PHYS 1810 or above, and the introductory laboratory 
course PHYS 2050L.
With prior written permission from the Mathematics DUS, students who completed 
multivariable calculus during high school may substitute a higher level mathematics 
course in the same area for MATH 1200. The course being substituted will not 
count toward the total of fourteen term courses (beyond the introductory level) 
required for the major.
Students who have taken the introductory physics lecture sequence PHYS 1700, 
PHYS 1710, or the physics laboratory sequence PHYS 1650L, PHYS 1660L, may also 
enter the major with permission of the Physics DUS.
Requirements of the Major
Students are held to the requirements that were in place when they declared their 
major. However, with approval from the DUS, the following requirements, updated for 
the academic year 2025–2026, may be fulﬁlled by students who declared the major in a 
prior term.
Beyond the prerequisites, the major requires ﬁfteen term courses for 14.5 credits, above 
the introductory level, including PHYS 2060L and the senior project. At least six of 
these must be mathematics courses numbered 2220–4690, and at least six must be 
ad
vanced physics courses (including the senior requirement) chosen in consultation 
with the adviser for the major. The two remaining courses may be either mathematics 
or physics courses.
A course must be listed with a math number to count toward the mathematics 
requirements, including the prerequisites—substitutions from other departments 
are not allowed. Graduate mathematics courses level 5000–5999 may be counted as 
electives; graduate mathematics courses level 6000 or above may not be counted.Mathematics and Physics         363
Senior Requirement
A senior project in PHYS 4710 or PHYS 4720 on a topic appropriate for the combined 
major and acceptable to both the Physics and the Mathematics departments is also 
required.
Credit/D/Fail No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of the major, including the prerequisites.
Outside credit
 Courses taken after matriculation at Yale at another institution or 
during an approved summer or term-time study abroad program may count toward the 
major requirements with DUS approval.
Advising
Gr
aduate classes/uni2002 Undergraduate students are welcome to enroll in courses level 
5000 and above, after completing the relevant pre-requisites. We recommend that 
students wishing to take graduate classes begin with courses level 5000 –5999, which 
are designed to be accessible to advanced undergraduates, and can be counted toward 
undergraduate requirements of the major. Courses level 6000 and above cannot be 
counted toward undergraduate requirements of the major, but they can earn graduation 
credit, and be applied toward the graduate requirement of the intensive mathematics 
major as well as toward the graduate requirement of the combined B.S./M.S. degree.
