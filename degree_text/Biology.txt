Yale oﬀers four biological science majors: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
(E&EB); Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry (MB&B); Molecular, Cellular, 
and Developmental Biology (MCDB); and Neuroscience (NSCI). The distinctions 
between these majors reﬂect the types of biological systems analysis each 
represents: the analysis of whole organisms, populations, and ecosystems 
(E&EB); the analysis of life at the molecular level using tools of chemistry and 
physics (MB&B); the analysis of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology, 
genetics, neurobiology, and quantitative biology (MCDB); and the analysis of neurons, 
neural circuits, brains, and behavior, using a wide range of approaches (NSCI). 
Yale also oﬀers the Biomedical Engineering (BENG) major for students interested 
in studying biological systems from the perspectives of the physical sciences and 
engineering.
Together, these approaches cover the vast breadth of disciplines in the biological 
sciences. The courses BIOL 1010–1040 are designed as entry points to all four 
programs. The prerequisites for the four majors are similar, so students need not 
commit to a speciﬁc major in their ﬁrst year. Students who wish to major in any of the 
four tracks (E&EB, MB&B, MCDB, and NSCI) must complete all four modules.
