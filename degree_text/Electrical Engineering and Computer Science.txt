Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
Directors of undergraduate studies: Rajit Manohar
(rajit.manohar@yale.edu) (Electrical Engineering), 523 BCT, 432-4306; Theodore Kim
(theodore.kim@yale.edu) (Computer Science), AKW 208A, 432-6400
Electrical Engineering and Computer Science is an interdepartmental major designed 
for students who want to integrate work in these two ﬁelds. It covers discrete and 
continuous mathematics, algorithm analysis and design, digital and analog circuits, 
signals and systems, systems programming, and computer engineering. It provides 
coherence in its core program, but allows ﬂexibility to pursue technical electives.
Prerequisites
The prerequisites for the major are MATH 1120 , 1150 (these prerequisites may be 
waived for students who have taken the equivalent of one year of calculus in high 
school) and ENAS 1510 or MATH 1200  (or a higher-level course); CPSC 1001  (for 
students without previous programming experience); and PHYS 1800 and 1810, 
or PHYS 2000 and 2010. PHYS 1700, 1710 are acceptable for students taking
MATH 1120 . Acceleration credits may not be used to satisfy prerequisites, and because 
the B.S. programs in Electrical Engineering and in Engineering Sciences (Electrical) 
both limit the use of such credits, students who wish to retain the option of switching 
to these programs should consult the director of undergraduate studies (DUS) in 
Electrical Engineering when planning their course schedules.
Requirements of the Major
The major requires ﬁfteen term courses beyond the prerequisites:
CPSC 2010 ; 2020; 2230; 3230; and either CPSC 3650  or 3660; ECE 2000 , ECE 2011,
ECE 2020 , and ECE 2031; one from MATH 2220 , 2250, 2260, S&DS 2380 , or
S&DS 2410 ; four advanced electives, two in electrical engineering, two in computer 
science; and a senior project. MATH 2440  may be substituted for CPSC 2020 . Electives 
must be 3000- or 4000-level courses in the departments of Electrical Engineering or
Computer Science or must be approved by the DUSs of both departments. Cross-
titled courses may be counted either way to fulﬁll this requirement. CPSC 2900  and
4900 may not be used as electives. Only one of CPSC 3650  and 3660 may be taken for 
major credit. With permission of the DUSs of both departments, one of ECE 4680  or
ECE 4691  may be used as an electrical engineering elective.
For students who have taken the equivalent of one year of calculus in high school and 
have some programming experience, a typical program would be:
First-Year Sophomore Junior Senior
ECE 2000 CPSC 2010 CPSC 2020 Senior project
ENAS 1510 ECE 2020 CPSC 3230 One elective
PHYS 1800
ECE 2011 CPSC 2230 CPSC 3650 or 3660 Two electives
PHYS 1810 ECE 2031 One elective
MATH 2220Electrical Engineering and Computer Science          273
Students with no programming experience should take CPSC 1001  in the fall 
of their ﬁrst year and either postpone ECE 2000  until their sophomore year or 
take ENAS 1510 or MATH 1200  in the spring.
For students with one term of calculus and no programming experience, a typical 
program would be:
First-Year Sophomore Junior Senior
CPSC 1001 CPSC 2010 CPSC 2020 Two electives
MATH 1150 ECE 2000 CPSC 3230
PHYS 1800 ECE 2020 S&DS 2410
ECE 2011 CPSC 2230 CPSC 3650 or 3660 Senior project
MATH 1200 ECE 2031 One elective One elective
PHYS 1810
For students with no calculus and no programming experience, a typical program 
would be:
First-Year Sophomore Junior Senior
CPSC 1001 CPSC 2010 CPSC 2020 Two electives
MATH 1120 ECE 2000 CPSC 3230
PHYS 1700 ENAS 1510 ECE 2020
ECE 2011 CPSC 2230 CPSC 3650 or 3660 Senior project
MATH 1150 MATH 2220 ECE 2031 One elective
PHYS 1710 One elective
Students who start with MATH 1120  may satisfy the physics prerequisite by taking
PHYS 1700 and 1710 in their ﬁrst year, as shown in the table above. However, because 
the B.S. programs in Electrical Engineering and in Engineering Sciences (Electrical) do 
not allow this substitution, students who wish to retain the option of switching to these 
programs should postpone physics until their sophomore year.
Credit/D/Fail No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of the major, including prerequisites.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
The senior project must be completed in CPSC 4900  or ECE 4710 and/or ECE 4721, 
depending on the adviser's department, and must be approved by the DUS in each 
department.
Advising and Approval of Programs
The entire program of a student majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer 
Science must be approved by the DUS in each department.
Accreditation Students interested in pursuing an ABET-accredited degree should 
consider the B.S. program in Electrical Engineering. See Electrical Engineering.274            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
