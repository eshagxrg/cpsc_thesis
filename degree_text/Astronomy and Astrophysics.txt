Astronomy and Astrophysics are quantitative physical sciences that apply physics, 
mathematics, and statistical analysis to observing, describing, and modeling the 
universe. The courses and degree programs oﬀered by the Department of Astronomy 
train students in research techniques and quantitative reasoning and develop creative 
problem solvers. The department oﬀers a B.A. degree in Astronomy and a B.S. degree 
in Astrophysics. The Astronomy degree is intended for students who plan to continue 
in adjacent ﬁelds such as science policy and science journalism. The Astrophysics degree 
is intended for students who plan to attend graduate school in related ﬁelds. Students 
who complete either major are sought after by employers in a range of ﬁelds from 
healthcare management to the banking and investment industry.
Introductory Courses
Introductory courses with no prerequisites/uni2002The department oﬀers a variety of courses 
without prerequisites that provide an introduction to astronomy with particular 
attention to recent discoveries and theories. Courses numbered below 1500 are intended 
for students who desire a broad, nontechnical introduction to astronomy. These courses 
fulﬁll the science distributional requirement, and some also fulﬁll the quantitative 
reasoning distributional requirement.
Courses with numbers from 1500 to 1999 are topical rather than survey courses. Most 
of these oﬀerings fulﬁll both the science and the quantitative reasoning requirements.
ASTR 1550 is a laboratory course that provides a hands-on introduction to astronomical 
observing. ASTR 1600 and ASTR 1700 provide an introduction to frontier topics in 
modern astrophysics and cosmology.
Introductory courses with high school calculus and physics prerequisites/uni2002Students 
who have taken calculus and physics in high school may enroll in quantitative 
introductory courses. ASTR 2100 and ASTR 2200 focus on fundamental measurements 
and tools used in astronomy and include an in-depth study of stellar astrophysics 
(ASTR 2100) or galaxies and cosmology (ASTR 2200). These courses overlap in 
content, so students should take either ASTR 2100 or ASTR 2200, but not both.
ASTR 2550 provides training in data analysis and research techniques, including 
computer programming and numerical and statistical analysis.
Prerequisites
B.A. degree program/uni2002The prerequisites for the B.A. degree are PHYS 1700 and
PHYS 1710, or PHYS 1800 and PHYS 1810, or PHYS 2000 and PHYS 2010, 
and MATH 1120  and 1150.
B.S. degree program/uni2002Prerequisites for the B.S. degree include an introductory physics 
sequence (PHYS 1800 and PHYS 1810, or PHYS 2000 and PHYS 2010, or PHYS 2600
and PHYS 2610); a physics laboratory sequence (PHYS 1650L and PHYS 1660L, 
or PHYS 2050L and PHYS 2060L); and the mathematics sequence MATH 1120 ,
MATH 1150 , and either MATH 1200  or ENAS 1510. ASTR 1550 may be substituted for 180            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
one term of the physics laboratory sequence. All prerequisites should be completed by 
the end of the sophomore year.
Prerequisites for advanced electives/uni2002Courses numbered 3000 and above are specialized 
and intensive. The prerequisites for these courses include ASTR 2100 or ASTR 2200, 
multivariable calculus, and two terms of introductory college physics.
Requirements of the Major
B.A. degree program/uni2002The B.A. degree program in Astronomy is designed for students 
who do not plan to continue in a graduate program in astronomy, but who are 
interested in the subject as a basis for a liberal arts education or as a physical science 
background to careers such as medicine, teaching, journalism, business, law, or 
government. It allows greater ﬂexibility in course selection than the B.S. program 
because the emphasis is on breadth of knowledge rather than on specialization.
Ten courses are required beyond the prerequisites, including either ASTR 2100 or 2200;
ASTR 2550; ASTR 3100; one additional Astronomy elective numbered 1500 or above; 
and the senior requirement (ASTR 4920). Two of the ten courses must be advanced 
courses in mathematics, such as MATH 1200  or ENAS 1510, or courses in mathematical 
methods, including statistics or computer science, such as CPSC 1001 , MATH 2000 or 
above, or ASTR 3560. Three electives can be drawn from any of the natural, applied, or 
mathematical sciences (including additional astronomy courses); at least two of these 
must be advanced enough to have college-level prerequisites.
B.S. degree program/uni2002The B.S. degree program in Astrophysics is designed to provide 
a strong foundation in astrophysics for students interested in graduate study or a career 
in astronomy, physics, or a related science.
Beyond the prerequisites, twelve courses are required in astronomy, physics, and 
mathematics. Students complete at least six courses in astronomy, including either
ASTR 2100 or 2200; ASTR 2550; ASTR 3100; ASTR 3200; and a two-term senior 
project (ASTR 4900 and 4910). Students also complete three physics courses 
numbered 4000 or above, normally PHYS 4010, PHYS 4020, and PHYS 4390. In 
addition, majors choose either one additional 4000-level course in physics or an 
astronomy elective numbered 3000 or higher. In mathematics, students complete a 
course in diﬀerential equations selected from MATH 2460 , PHYS 4000, or ENAS 1940, 
and either an additional mathematics course numbered 2000 or above or a course in 
statistics or computing such as CPSC 1001 , CPSC 2010 , or ASTR 3560.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the major 
requirements of either degree program.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
B.A. degree program/uni2002The senior requirement consists of a senior essay or independent 
research project carried out for one term in ASTR 4920 under the supervision of a 
faculty member.Astronomy & Astrophysics         181
B.S. degree program/uni2002The senior requirement consists of an independent research 
project in astronomy carried out for two terms in ASTR 4900 and ASTR 4910 under 
the supervision of a faculty member.
Advising
Before entering the junior year, students must obtain approval of a course of study from 
the director of undergraduate studies (DUS).
Graduate work/uni2002Graduate courses in astronomy are open to qualiﬁed undergraduates 
who already have a strong preparation in mathematics, physics, and astronomy. 
Students wishing to take a graduate course must ﬁrst obtain the permission of the 
instructor and of the director of graduate studies.
