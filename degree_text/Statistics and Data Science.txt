Statistics is the science and art of prediction and explanation. The mathematical 
foundation of statistics lies in the theory of probability, which is applied to problems 
of making inferences and decisions under uncertainty. Practical statistical analysis 
also uses a variety of computational techniques, methods of visualizing and exploring 
data, methods of seeking and establishing structure and trends in data, and a mode 
of questioning and reasoning that quantiﬁes uncertainty. Data science expands on 
statistics to encompass the entire life cycle of data, from its speciﬁcation, gathering, 
and cleaning, through its management and analysis, to its use in making decisions and 
setting policy. This ﬁeld is a natural outgrowth of statistics that incorporates advances 
in machine learning, data mining, and high-performance computing, along with 
domain expertise in the social sciences, natural sciences, engineering, management, 
medicine, and digital humanities.
Students majoring in Statistics and Data Science take courses in both mathematical and 
practical foundations. They are also encouraged to take courses in the discipline areas 
listed below.
The B.A. in Statistics and Data Science is designed to acquaint students with 
fundamental techniques in the ﬁeld. The B.S. prepares students to participate in 
research eﬀorts or to pursue graduate school in the study of data science.
Courses for Nonmajors and Majors
S&DS 1000 , 1090, and 1230 (YData) assume knowledge of high-school mathematics 
only. S&DS 1080  requires some previous coursework in statistics such as high school 
AP Statistics. Students who complete one of these courses should consider taking
S&DS 2300 . This sequence provides a solid foundation for the major. Other courses for 
nonmajors include S&DS 1100  and S&DS 1600 .
Prerequisites
Multivariable calculus is required and should be taken before or during the sophomore 
year. This requirement may be satisﬁed by one of MATH 1200 , ENAS 1510,
MATH 3020 , or the equivalent.
Requirements of the Major
See Links to the attributes indicating courses approved for the Statistics and Data 
Science major requirements.
Students who wish to major in Statistics and Data Science are encouraged to 
take S&DS 2200  or a 1000-level course followed by S&DS 2300 . Students should 
complete the calculus prerequisite and linear algebra requirement (MATH 2220
or MATH 2250  or MATH 2260 ) as early as possible, as they provide mathematical 
background that is required in many courses.
B.A. degree program/uni2002The B.A. degree program requires eleven courses, ten of which 
are from the seven discipline areas described below: MATH 2220  or MATH 2250  orStatistics and Data Science         467
MATH 2260  from Mathematical Foundations and Theory; two courses from Core 
Probability and Statistics; two courses that provide Computational Skills; two courses 
on Methods of Data Science; and three courses from any of the discipline areas subject 
to DUS approval. The remaining course is fulﬁlled through the senior requirement.
B.S. degree program/uni2002The B.S. degree program requires fourteen courses, including 
all the requirements for the B.A. degree. Speciﬁcally, B.S. degree candidates must 
take S&DS 2420  and S&DS 3650  to fulﬁll the B.A. requirements. The three remaining 
courses include one course chosen from the Mathematical Foundations and Theory 
discipline and two courses chosen from Core Probability and Statistics (not including
S&DS 2420 ), Computational Skills, Methods of Data Science (not including
S&DS 3650 ), Mathematical Foundations and Theory, or Eﬃcient Computation and Big 
Data discipline areas subject to DUS approval.
