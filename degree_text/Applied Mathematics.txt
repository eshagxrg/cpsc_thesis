Applied Mathematics

Mathematical models are widely used throughout natural science, social science, 
and engineering in ﬁelds as diverse as physics, bioinformatics, robotics, image 
processing, and economics. Despite the broad range of mathematical settings and 
applications, there exists a core of essential concepts and techniques used in addressing 
most problems. The Applied Mathematics major provides a foundation in these 
mathematical techniques and prepares the student to use them in a substantive ﬁeld of 
application.
The interdisciplinary major permits a great deal of ﬂexibility in design. It is intended 
to appeal to students who wish to study the more mathematical aspects of science 
or engineering, as well as those whose primary interest is in mathematics and 
statistics and who wish to become acquainted with applications. Core courses are 
drawn from Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics and Data Science, and
Engineering and Applied Science. Courses applying mathematics may be drawn from 
participating programs in Applied Physics; Astronomy & Astrophysics; the biological 
sciences, including Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Biophysics and 
Biochemistry, and Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology; Chemistry;
Economics ; the various programs in engineering, including Biomedical Engineering,
Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and
Mechanical Engineering; Earth and Planetary Sciences; Physics; and even Linguistics
and Political Science. The Applied Mathematics degree program requires a three-course 
concentration in a ﬁeld in which mathematics is used.
Students in the major are often sought after by graduate programs in either Applied 
Mathematics or in the disciplines in which they choose their concentration, as well as 
by industries and startup companies in which their breadth of quantitative skills are 
essential and often unique.
Students may pursue a major in Applied Mathematics as one of two majors and can 
thereby equip themselves with mathematical modeling skills while being fully engaged 
in a ﬁeld of application. In this case, the concentration requirement of the Applied 
Mathematics program is ﬂexible in order to recognize the contribution of the other 
major. A two-course overlap is permitted to satisfy the requirements of the two majors.
Frequently Asked Questions/uni2002Students are encouraged to consult the Applied 
Mathematics FAQ for more details about courses and policies in the major.
Prerequisite and Introductory Courses□
Multivariable calculus and linear algebra are required and should be taken before 
or during the sophomore year. This requirement may be satisﬁed by MATH 1200
or ENAS 1510, and MATH 2220  or 2250 or 2260. Computer programming skills are 
also required and may be acquired by taking ENAS 1300 or CPSC 1001  . Details 
of individual programs must be worked out in consultation with the director of 
undergraduate studies (DUS), whose signed permission is required.Applied Mathematics         161

* Because departmental curricula from which the program draws regularly change, the 
DUS maintains a more exhaustive list of courses and areas satisfying this particular 
requirement. Additionally, due to rapid advances in many areas, these categories are 
often ﬂuid, and their union can evolve. In order to accommodate this ﬂuidity, students 
are strongly encouraged to revisit their program of study each term and share their
checklist with the DUS. Students can independently and systematically plan multiple 162            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
routes toward completion of the major by using the checklist and the master list of 
courses.
** Chemistry courses numbered 410 and above may count as a breadth requirement 
(either 1 full-term 1 credit course or 2 half-credit courses) with permission of the DUS.
6. At least three advanced courses in a ﬁeld of concentration involving the application of 
mathematics to that ﬁeld. The standard way to form a concentration is to take three 
courses all from the same breadth (a)-(m) category from item 5 above, at least two 
of which are level 3000+. Any concentration that deviates from this standard formula 
must be worked out in consultation with, and approved by, the DUS. 
Alternatively, when two majors are undertaken, if the second major is in a participating 
program, then, recognizing that there can be an overlap of two courses, the student may 
take for the remaining concentration course an additional choice relevant to the Applied 
Mathematics major such as those listed in point 5 above or for the B.S. degree below. 
Details of a student's program to satisfy the concentration requirement must be worked 
out in consultation with, and approved by, the DUS.
The B.S. degree program/uni2002In addition to the courses indicated for the B.A. degree, the 
B.S. degree, which totals fourteen term courses beyond the prerequisites and includes 
the senior requirement, must also include the three items listed below.
1. A vector analysis course (MATH 3020  or MATH 3050 ). MATH 3100 , 3200, 3250, and
4470 and those 3000+ level courses listed under "(c) partial diﬀerential equations and 
analysis" can act as replacements.
The course selected may not be counted toward the requirements for the major under 
item 5 above. (MATH 3500  and MATH 4400  can in speciﬁc cases be considered in 
consultation with the DUS.) 
2. An additional course selected from item 5 above.
3. Another course numbered 3000 or higher selected from item 5 above, or a course 
numbered 3000 or higher in mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, or 
quantitative computer science or engineering, or as approved by the DUS.
Alternatively, students may petition to receive a B.S. in Applied Mathematics by 
fulﬁlling the B.A. requirements in Applied Mathematics and the B.S. requirements in 
another program.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No more than one course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward 
the requirements of the major.
Distinction in the major Earn a grade of A or A– in at least 9/11 of the non-prerequisite 
courses in the Applied Math B.A., or at least 11/14 of the non-prerequisite courses in 
the B.S. One of those A’s or A–’s must come from AMTH 4900 or AMTH 4910, with 
the rest coming from core, concentration, and/or breadth courses. Grades of Cr in 
classes taken Cr/D/F count as non-A grades. Grades earned in prerequisite courses 
(multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and programming), and grades of P or W, do 
not count in the calculation.Applied Mathematics         163
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
Both the B.A. and B.S. degree programs require a senior thesis research project 
(AMTH 4910 ).
