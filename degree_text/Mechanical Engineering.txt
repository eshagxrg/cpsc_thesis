Mechanical engineering is among the most diversiﬁed of the traditional engineering 
disciplines. The mechanical engineer builds machines to extend our physical and 
mental capabilities and to convert traditional and novel energy sources into useful 
forms.
The role of the mechanical engineer has changed dramatically over the past few 
decades with the extensive use of high-performance computers (in such areas as 
computational ﬂuid dynamics, materials design, control, and manufacturing), the 
interfacing of microelectromechanical systems and actuators via microprocessors to 
build high-precision sensors and devices, and the advent of advanced materials (e.g., 
composites, shape-memory alloys, ceramics, and superconductors) for new applications 
(e.g., coatings, biomaterials, and computer storage). These areas o ﬀer mechanical 
engineering students special opportunities for creativity, demanding that they learn 
not only in depth but also in breadth. Demands for increased energy eﬃciency and 
reduced environmental impact—as might be realized, for example, in novel gas turbine 
or electric hybrid vehicles—require that students understand the fundamentals of 
mechanics, thermodynamics, ﬂuid mechanics, combustion, and materials science. In all 
these tasks, the utmost consideration of the modern mechanical engineer is improving 
the quality of human life. The engineer must also be constantly aware both of the 
ﬁniteness of Earth’s resources and its environment and of the burden that engineering 
places on them.
The educational mission of the Department of Mechanical Engineering is to provide 
an excellent education that will prepare students to become members of the next 
generation of mechanical engineers. To implement this mission, the department 
adheres to the following set of educational objectives: to provide a balanced technical 
and nontechnical education to enable graduates to enter highly selective graduate 
schools and/or to pursue technical careers in industry or government laboratories; to 
enable graduates to improve and adapt their skills to accommodate rapid technological 
changes; to prepare graduates to communicate e ﬀectively and to understand the 
ethical responsibilities and impact on society of their profession. To achieve these 
objectives, the following fundamental educational goals have been established for the 
Department of Mechanical Engineering: to provide a comprehensive introduction to 
basic science and mathematics, which form the foundation of mechanical engineering; 
to provide thorough training in analytical and experimental methods and in data 
analysis, including problem formulation; to provide instruction in the fundamentals 
of the design process, including project innovation, synthesis, and management, both 
individually and in a team setting; to provide both a technical and a nontechnical 
program of study in which oral and written communication skills are developed; and 
to instill in students an understanding of their professional and ethical responsibilities, 
which aﬀect society and their profession.Mechanical Engineering         365
Courses for Nonmajors
Mechanics and mechanical engineering content can be found in several courses 
intended for those not majoring in science. See Engineering and Applied Science.
The Mechanical Engineering Program
At Yale, three mechanical engineering programs are oﬀered: a B.S. degree program with 
a major in Mechanical Engineering, a B.S. degree program with a major in Engineering 
Sciences (Mechanical), and a B.A. degree program with a major in Engineering 
Sciences (Mechanical). Prospective majors in both B.S. programs are advised to 
complete introductory physics and mathematics through calculus (MATH 1150 ) by the 
end of their ﬁrst year.
A student's undergraduate engineering program may include one or more special 
project courses MENG 4991  or MENG 4992  in which the student pursues a particular 
research interest through design-oriented projects and experimental investigations. 
Projects may be initiated by the student, may be performed in a team, or may be derived 
from the ideas of faculty members who place undergraduates in their ongoing research 
projects. All interested students should contact the director of undergraduate studies 
(DUS) for more information on special project courses.
B.S. degree program in Mechanical Engineering/uni2002This is the most technically 
intensive mechanical engineering degree program and is accredited by the Engineering 
Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc. This program is appropriate for students 
who plan careers as practicing engineers in industry, consulting ﬁrms, or government, 
as well as for students who are considering a career in research and plan to pursue an 
advanced degree in engineering.
B.S. degree program in Engineering Sciences (Mechanical) This non-ABET 
degree program is suitable for students who wish to gain signiﬁcant expertise within 
mechanical engineering while combining their engineering studies with related 
disciplines. For example, a number of students have taken courses in architecture while 
pursuing a program in mechanical engineering that emphasizes structural mechanics; 
similarly, a student with an interest in computer graphics might combine engineering 
courses in computer-aided design with programming courses from the Department of 
Computer Science.
B.A. degree program in Engineering Sciences (Mechanical) In a society with 
increasing levels of technical sophistication, a well-rounded individual must have 
some background in science and technology. The non-ABET B.A. program is designed 
for students who may be planning careers in business, law, economics, medicine, 
journalism, or politics but need to understand the impact that science and technology 
can have on society at large. An understanding of engineering methods and practices, 
combined with a traditional liberal arts education, provides a strong background for 
a variety of careers. The program is well suited for students who wish to fulﬁll the 
requirements of two majors.
The major  for all three degree programs requires a group of prerequisites or 
equivalents; several courses beyond the prerequisites; and a senior requirement, as 
indicated below.366            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
