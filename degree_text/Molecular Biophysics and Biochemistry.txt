Members of the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry (MB&B) are 
united by a common view that processes in biology are understood when molecular, 
chemical, kinetic, and thermodynamic contributions to mechanisms have been 
elucidated. Correspondingly, our faculty and students are joined by a shared fascination 
with biochemistry, physical chemistry, structural biology, computation, spectroscopy, 
macromolecular engineering, imaging and the molecular basis of disease. 
Three quarters of our graduates matriculate into PhD, MD, and MD/PhD 
programs. Other recent graduates have joined companies specializing in ﬁnance, 
management consulting, biotechnology, and pharma. Others have matriculated in 
law or business school and doctoral programs in the humanities. Still others have 
performed public service, entered secondary education, or joined the United States 
armed forces as oﬃcers.
Introductory courses
The basic introductory science courses suggested for all majors include a two-
term lecture sequence in general chemistry with its associated laboratories 
(CHEM 1610 , 1650, or CHEM 1630 , 1670, and CHEM 1340L  and 1360L); a one-
term course in organic chemistry with its associated laboratory (CHEM 2200  or 1740
with CHEM 2220L ); two terms of calculus (MATH 1120  and 1150 or MATH 1160 );
two half-term units of biochemistry, biophysics and cell biology (BIOL 1010 , 1020). 
Some concentrations, described below, require additional introductory biology satisﬁed 
by (BIOL 1030 , 1040).
Requirements of the major
The core elements of the major are biophysics, biochemistry, and science and 
society. The requirements beyond these core elements teach advanced concepts, and 
teach the technology and practical skills that enable scholarship in the discipline.
B.A. Degree Program/uni2002The B.A. degree program requires a total of 9.5 course credits 
to include:  3 biophysics credits; 3 biochemistry credits, a half-credit for science and 
society; 1 credit to fulﬁll the practical skills requirement; 1 elective; and the senior 
requirement. 
The core Biophysics requirements are two semesters of physics (PHYS 1700 and 1710 or 
higher) and one semester of biophysical chemistry (MB&B 2750  or CHEM 3320 ).
The core Biochemistry requirements include MB&B 3000  and 3010 (substitutions are not 
permitted), and CHEM 1750  or any 2000+ level Chemistry course.
The Science and Society core requirement is 0.5 credit (MB&B 2680  is recommended) and 
addresses the intersection of Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry with human identity 
and society. Alternatives to MB&B 2680  are MB&B 1070 , AFAM 1370, HSHM 2060 ,
241, 4060, 4240, 4750, 4810, HIST 1779, SOCY 1600 , 1601, 3760, MCDB 3750 ,
WGSS 2270, 4457. Students may petition for course substitutions.374            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
The Practical skills  requirement is fulﬁlled with one full-credit or two half-credit courses 
spread across two or three of the categories listed below.  At least one half-credit must 
come from MB&B.   
•Physics lab options include  MB&B 1210L , 1220L, 1230L, 1240L, 4700 and 4710*,
PHYS 1650L , 1660L, CHEM 3550L , other 2000+ level lab courses with DUS approval.
•Biochemistry Lab options include  MB&B 2510L , 4700 and 4710*, CHEM 3550L , other
2000+ level lab courses with DUS approval.
•Critical Tools options include MB&B 4350, 4700 and 4710*, S&DS 2380, CPSC 1001
and others with DUS approval.
*MB&B 4700 and 4710 are research for credit courses. Above categorization is  
dependent on the research project. Up to two credits may be taken for a letter grade.
The Elective course should be a lecture or seminar MB&B course at the 2000+ level.
B.S. Degree Program/uni2002The B.S. degree program requires a total of 12.5 course credits 
including the senior requirement. This program follows the requirements and policies 
of the B.A. degree program with the following additions. 
For the core Biophysics requirement: one additional 3000+ course in physical sciences, 
ma
thematics, statistics or computer science
For the Practical Skills requirement: one additional credit for a total of two credits
For the
 elective courses: one additional 2000+ level seminar or lecture course in STEM
Combined B.S./M.S. Degree Program/uni2002The B.S./M.S. degree program requires 
a total of 18.5 course credits including the senior requirement. See Academic 
Regulations, section L, Special Academic Arrangements, “Simultaneous Award of the 
Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees.” Interested students should consult their academic 
adviser prior to the ﬁfth term of enrollment for details and application requirements 
(due December 1 of the ﬁfth semester). The B.S./M.S. program follows the 
requirements of the B.S. Degree program with the following additions.
For the 
core Biophysics requirement: one additional 3000+ course 
in thermodynamics, statistical mech, quantum and/or spectroscopy (CHEM 3320 is 
recommended). PHYS 1800 and 1810 in place of PHYS 1700 and 1710.
The Practical Skills requirement is replaced by one semester of MB&B 4700 or
MB&B 4710 which must be completed by the end of the ﬁfth semester.
For the Elective course, the single MB&B 2000+ seminar or lecture elective is replaced by 
two MB&B electives at 5000+ and four 5000+ electives in STEM.
Concentrations
Concentrations in MB&B are sets of electives, curated by faculty, designed 
to focus attention on speciﬁc subﬁelds of Molecular Biophysics and 
Biochemistry. Concentrations appear on a student’s official Yale transcript and are 
currently available in Biochemistry; Biophysics and Structural Biology; Chemical 
Biology; Computational Biology and Bioinformatics; Environment and Climate 
Change; and Medicine. Students must fulﬁll all major degree requirements, Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry          375
earning a concentration is optional. For speciﬁc concentration requirements see the 
Concentrations section.
Electives taken for the major that meet the same criteria as requirements for a 
concentration may be used to fulﬁll both requirements. Placement exams and 
acceleration credits do not count towards completion of concentration-speciﬁc 
requirements. Instead, majors enroll in higher-level courses in the same concentration-
speciﬁc category. Depending on the particular concentration and the choice of electives, 
concentrations add between zero and three additional credits to major requirements.
Some concentrations include research-for-credit courses or course-based undergraduate 
research experiences (CUREs) as a mechanism to fulﬁll a requirement. These courses 
must directly relate to the chosen concentration (broadly interpreted) and require DUS 
approval.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002 No more than one course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward 
the requirements of the major. This does count against Yale ’s limit of 6 total Credit/
D/Fail courses. Qualifying courses must be 4000+ in MB&B, and 3000+ in any other 
STEM subject. For B.S./M.S. students, all required coursework must be taken for a 
letter grade.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
te
rm-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
The senior requirement for both the B.S. and the B.A. is fulﬁlled by successful 
completion of a one credit senior essay. Students may enroll in MB&B 4900 and 
prepare a written report and make an oral presentation of a literature project or students 
may enroll in MB&B 4910 and write an essay that draws on laboratory research 
performed at Yale College. Students meet with faculty members in charge of the 
courses during the ﬁrst two weeks of the term in which they are writing their essay, 
to agree on a topic and an approach. It is appropriate for students who took research 
for credit earlier in their training to write on their research topic. The literature project 
for the senior requirement should be original work approved by the faculty member 
overseeing MB&B 4900.
The senior requirement for B.S./M.S. is completion of MB&B 5700 and 5701 taken 
during senior year. 
Advising
Students are encouraged to declare their major long before completion of the 
introductory courses. This greatly improves academic advising. Changing majors at 
Yale does not require approval and is non-binding.
Students are assigned a member of MB&B faculty for academic advising as soon as they 
declare their major. Requests to change advisers should be sent to the registrar via email 
(elizabeth.vellali@yale.edu). Justiﬁcation is not required nor is DUS approval.
Course Substitutions Students may petition their MB&B academic adviser for course 
substitutions by assembling the relevant syllabi and writing a short justiﬁcation (less 376            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
than 300 words). Thoughtful requests in line with MB&Bs teaching goals are always 
welcome.
DUS approvals: DUS approvals for waivers, course substitutions, endorsement of 
petitions to the Committee on Honors and Academic Standing, applications to the 
B.S./M.S. program etc., are initiated by an email of support from student ’s assigned 
MB&B academic adviser. The academic adviser functions as the student’s advocate on  
requests to the DUS with the MB&B registrar giving oversight and interfacing with 
the University registrar. One-on-one meetings by majors with their MB&B academic 
adviser during every registration period are logged. Failure to schedule meetings and 
missed meetings are factored into the DUS approval process.
Graduate work/uni2002 Graduate courses in molecular biophysics and biochemistry, biology, 
and the biomedical sciences that may be of interest to undergraduates are listed in the 
Graduate School online bulletin, and many are posted on the Biological and Biomedical 
Sciences website. Additional information is available from the DUSs and the director of 
graduate studies. Undergraduates with an appropriate background may enroll with the 
permission of the director of graduate studies and the instructor.
Combined B.S./M.S. degree program/uni2002A very small number of students will be eligible 
to complete a four-year course of study within 8 terms of enrollment leading to the 
simultaneous award of the B.S. and M.S. degrees. See Academic Regulations, section L, 
Special Academic Arrangements, “Simultaneous Award of the Bachelor’s and Master’s 
Degr
ees.” Interested students should consult their academic adviser prior to the ﬁfth 
term of enrollment.
Sample schedules/uni2002Diverse pathways exist for navigating the B.A. and B.S. degrees. In 
general, students are strongly encouraged to complete General Chemistry 
(e.g. CHEM 1610, 1650, 1340L and 1360L), introductory calculus (e.g. MATH 1120) 
and introductory Biochemistry, Biophysics and Cell Biology (BIOL 1010, 1020)
by the end of their ﬁrst year. See the MB&B website for 4-year sample degree 
programs covering all six concentrations and for students who do not elect to pursue a 
concentration.

biochemistry concentration
The concentration in Biochemistry is geared towards students seeking robust 
training in structure and function of nucleic acids and proteins in the context of life 
processes. Molecular length scale biochemistry is foundational to the mechanisms 
by which dynamic networks of molecular machines enable everything from cellular 
function to whole organism physiology. Failures in these networks are responsible for 
pathology in plants and animals, agriculture and medicine. MB&B majors interested
