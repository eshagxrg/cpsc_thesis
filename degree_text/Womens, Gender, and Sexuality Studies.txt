Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies

Genders and sexualities are powerful organizing forces: they shape identities and 
institutions, nations and economies, cultures, and political systems. Careful study 
of gender and sexuality thus explains crucial aspects of our everyday lives on both 
intimate and global scales. Scholarship in Women ’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies 
is interdisciplinary and wide ranging, drawing on history, literature, cultural studies, 
social sciences, and natural science to study genders and sexualities as they intersect 
with race, ethnicity, class, nationality, transnational processes, disability, and religion.
Students majoring in Women ’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies take a series of core 
courses, develop an individual area of focus, and write a yearlong or single-term senior 
essay. The program encourages work that is interdisciplinary, intersectional, 
international, and transnational. Individual focus areas evolve along with students’ 
intellectual growth and academic expertise. Recent examples of areas of focus include 
literature and queer aesthetics; transnational feminist practices; the intellectual history 
of civil rights activism; AIDS health policies; gender, religion, and international NGOs; 
women’s health; food, sexuality, and lesbian community; and gender and sexuality in 
early education.
Requirements of the Major 
Students are held to the requirements in place when they declared their major. 
However, with approval from the director of undergraduate studies (DUS), the 
following requirements, updated for the academic year 2024
–2025, may be fulﬁlled by 
students who declared the major in a prior term.
Twelve term courses are required and this major may be taken either as a primary major 
or as one of two majors. Requirements include two intermediate courses selected from 
WGSS 2205, WGSS 2206, WGSS 2207, or WGSS 3340. Majors are strongly encouraged 
to take these intermediate courses during their ﬁrst two years. The major also requires 
one methodology course, seven courses in an area of focus (one of which must be 
an upper-level seminar in WGSS numbered 3350 or above) and a two-course senior 
requirement. The area of focus consists of at least seven courses, the majority of which 
should be drawn from program o ﬀerings. Substitutions to the major requirements may 
be made only with the written permission of the DUS.
Methodology courses/uni2002Given its interdisciplinary nature, the Women ’s, Gender, 
and Sexuality Studies major necessarily relies on a wide range of methodologies: 
literary criticism, ethnography, visual analysis, historiography, and quantitative data 
analysis, among others. Each student is expected to acquire competence in at least one 
methodology relevant to their area of focus and planned senior essay. Students are 
advised to take a methodology course by their junior year in preparation for the senior 
essay. Methodology courses may be drawn from any department, but are subject to 
DUS approval for WGSS credit.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No more than two courses taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward 
the requirements of the major.484            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
The two-term senior essay/uni2002
The two-term senior sequence consists of WGSS 4490, The 
Senior Colloquium, in which students begin researching and writing a senior essay, 
followed by WGSS 4491, The Senior Essay, in which students complete the essay. The 
senior essay is developed and written under the guidance and supervision of a WGSS-
affiliated faculty member with expertise in the area of focus, with a minimum of sixty 
pages and a maximum of ninety pages (excluding front matter, bibliography and 
appendices). Students are expected to meet with their essay advisers on a regular basis.
The single-term senior essay/uni2002Majors may opt to complete the senior essay requirement 
in an approved upper-level WGSS seminar in the fall or spring term, with the approval 
of the instructor, by writing a senior essay of at least thirty pages (excluding front 
matter, bibliography and appendices) in lieu of the course’s normal writing 
requirements. Students who choose the single-term senior essay take one additional 
WGSS course of their choosing to fulﬁll the twelve-term-course requirement.
