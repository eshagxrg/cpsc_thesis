Physics is the study of the fundamental laws of nature. Applied physics uses these 
laws to understand phenomena that have practical applications. Engineering in turn 
makes use of these phenomena for human purposes. Applied physics thus forms a link 
between the fundamental laws of nature and their applications. Students majoring 
in Applied Physics take courses in both physics and engineering, as well as courses 
speciﬁcally in applied physics. Students completing the program in Applied Physics 
are prepared for graduate study in applied physics, in physics, in nanoscience, or in 
engineering, and, with appropriate prerequisites, in medicine; or they may choose 
careers in a wide range of technical and commercial ﬁelds, or in ﬁelds such as technical 
writing or patent law that draw on interdisciplinary subjects.
Contemporary physical science and engineering are becoming increasingly 
interdisciplinary. Traditional boundaries between ﬁelds have blurred, and new areas 
are constantly emerging, e.g., nanotechnology. The Applied Physics major provides 
a ﬂexible framework on which students can build a curriculum tailored to their own 
interests, in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies (DUS).
Prerequisites 
During their ﬁrst year, students interested in Applied Physics should start by taking 
courses in mathematics, and in physics if possible, appropriate to their level of 
preparation. The choice between diﬀerent starting points is generally made based on 
performance on Advanced Placement tests. The multiplicity of choices facing students 
interested in this general area indicates the importance of informed advice for ﬁrst-year 
students. Students should consult freely with DUSs and individual faculty members in 
their departments of interest to optimize choices and to ensure maximum ﬂexibility at 
the time a major is selected.
The required prerequisites for students interested in Applied Physics include two 
physics courses and one physics lab; APHY 1510  or MATH 1200 ; and PHYS 4000 (or
APHY 1940  with either MATH 2220  or MATH 2250  or MATH 2260 ).
The recommended starting courses in physics are PHYS 2000 and 2010. These 
courses should be taken in the ﬁrst year by students who have a strong preparation in 
mathematics and physics. Students with a particularly strong background in physics 
and mathematics may take PHYS 2600 and 2610 instead. Students who are less well 
prepared in physics and mathematics may choose to take PHYS 1800 and 1810 during 
their ﬁrst year, or PHYS 2000 and 2010 during their sophomore year after they have 
taken additional mathematics courses. One laboratory course, PHYS 1660L or 2060L, 
should be taken at some time during the ﬁrst or second year.
Requirements of the Major 
The major in Applied Physics requires eight courses beyond the introductory sequence. 
Two of these must be APHY 4710  and 4720. All majors are also required to take
APHY 3220 , APHY 4390  or PHYS 4400, and APHY 4200 , or equivalents. The three 
remaining advanced courses should comprise an area of focus. For example, a student 
interested in solid-state and/or quantum electronics might choose from APHY 3210 ,166            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
4480, 4490, ECE 3200 , and 3250. A student interested in the physics of materials and/
or nanoscience might choose from APHY 4480 , 4490, CHEM 2200 , and MENG 2615 . 
Many other focus areas are possible.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No more than one course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward 
the requirements of the major with permission of the DUS. The senior special projects,
APHY 4710  and 4720, may only be taken for a letter grade.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement 
Seniors must complete an independent research project, taken as APHY 4710  and
4720. The independent research project is under the supervision of a faculty member 
in Applied Physics, Physics, Engineering, or related departments. The project may be 
started in the junior year and continued into the senior year. Students planning to do a 
research project should contact the DUS as early as possible to discuss available options 
and general requirements.
Advising
The Applied Physics major provides various programs corresponding to a range of 
student interests. Substitutions of equivalent courses may be permitted. Students 
interested in an Applied Physics major should contact the DUS as early as possible, and 
in any case by the end of their sophomore year.
A well-prepared student interested in materials physics or quantum electronics who 
starts the senior research in the junior year might elect the following course sequence:
First-Year Sophomore Junior Senior
APHY 1510 APHY 3220 APHY 4720 APHY 4480
PHYS 2000 APHY 4390 ECE 3200 APHY 4490
PHYS 2010 PHYS 4000 APHY 4200 APHY 4710
PHYS 2060L
A student interested in alternative energy who starts physics in the sophomore year and 
conducts research in the senior year might elect:
First-Year Sophomore Junior Senior
MATH 1200 PHYS 2000 APHY 3220 APHY 4480
PHYS 2010 APHY 4390 APHY 4710
