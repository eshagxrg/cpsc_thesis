Energy, the environment, and health care are key challenges facing humanity 
in the twenty-ﬁrst century. Chemical engineering is a discipline well placed to 
confront these challenges. Chemical engineering is rooted in the basic sciences of 
mathematics, chemistry, physics, and biology; a traditional engineering science core 
of thermodynamics, transport phenomena, and chemical kinetics; a rigorous design 
component; and an expanding focus on emerging topics in materials, nanotechnology, 
and life sciences. The discipline has grown from its petrochemical origins to become 
central to state-of-the-art technologies in microelectronics, alternative energy, 
biomedicine, and pharmaceutics.
The Chemical Engineering program, with two degree programs (see below), is 
principally focused on basic and engineering sciences and on problem solving. 
Additional emphasis is on communication, analysis of experiments, and chemical 
process design. A special feature of the program is the accessibility of laboratory 
research—most chemical engineering majors participate in faculty-led research projects, 
often resulting in publication and/or presentation at national meetings.
Chemical engineering graduates ﬁnd a wide range of professional opportunities in 
academia, industry, government, business, and the nonproﬁt sector. Many majors go 
on to graduate programs in chemical, biomedical, or environmental engineering, or to 
medical, law, or business schools.
Upon graduation, Yale's Chemical Engineering students are expected to have achieved 
"Student Outcomes" as deﬁned by ABET (www.abet.org) and the program. The 
Chemical Engineering major produces graduates who demonstrate: (1) an ability to 
identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of 
engineering, science, and mathematics; (2) an ability to apply engineering design to 
produce solutions that meet speciﬁed needs with consideration of public health, safety, 
and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors; 
(3) an ability to communicate eﬀectively with a range of audiences; (4) an ability to 
recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and to 
make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions 
in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts; (5) an ability to function 
eﬀectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative 
and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives; (6) an 
ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, 
and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions; and (7) an ability to acquire and 
apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
Yale and ABET also look ahead, several years beyond graduation. Program educational 
objectives provide the expectations for graduates early in their career. The Chemical 
Engineering objectives are to produce graduates who: (1) have mastery of the basic 
principles of science and modern chemical engineering practice and are able to adapt 
and creatively apply them to solve new problems in a broad range of ﬁelds; (2) become 
ethical professionals who advance chemical engineering practice and knowledge in Chemical Engineering         189
multiple ﬁelds and recognize the local and global impacts of their work on humans 
and the environment; (3) are able to work well with people from diverse backgrounds 
and are committed to the advancement of women and under-represented groups 
in engineering; (4) have a strong educational foundation enabling them to study in 
graduate and professional schools as well as become leaders in STEM or non-STEM 
career paths; and (5) are committed to, and engage in, lifelong learning throughout 
their careers.
Prerequisites
Students considering a Chemical Engineering major are encouraged to take two terms 
of chemistry and mathematics during the ﬁrst year, and to contact the director of 
undergraduate studies (DUS).
Students in both degree programs (see below) take the following prerequisite 
courses: MATH 1120 , 1150, and ENAS 1510 or MATH 1200 ; CHEM 1610  and 1650 or
CHEM 1630  and 1670; CHEM 1340L  and 1360L; PHYS 1800, 1810 or PHYS 2000,
2010 or PHYS 2600. Students with advanced high school preparation may reduce the 
number of prerequisites by placing out of certain courses.
