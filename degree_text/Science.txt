Yale College oﬀers several interdepartmental course sequences for ﬁrst-year students 
through the First-Year Seminar Program. In these courses, students encounter current 
research at Yale and in the broader scientiﬁc community across a wide range of scientiﬁc 
ﬁelds. The courses intend to develop skills necessary to understand, write, and present 
research in these areas. Students also identify a Yale research mentor and prepare an 
independent grant proposal to prepare for summer research.
