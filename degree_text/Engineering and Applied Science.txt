Courses in Engineering and Applied Science fall into three categories: those intended 
primarily for students majoring in one of the several engineering and applied science 
disciplines; those designed for students majoring in subjects other than engineering, 
the applied sciences, and the natural sciences; and those designed to meet common 
interests of students majoring in engineering, the applied sciences, or the natural 
sciences.
In the ﬁrst category, the departments of Applied Physics, Biomedical Engineering, 
Chemical and Environmental Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, 
and Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science oﬀer courses intended primarily for 
majors in engineering and applied science disciplines. Courses in these departments 
may also be relevant for students with appropriate backgrounds who are majoring 
in Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Earth and Planetary Studies, and Mathematics. 
For information about majors in engineering and their related courses, see Applied 
Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Computer Science, Electrical 
Engineering, Environmental Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering.
The School of Engineering and Applied Science is responsible for courses in the other 
two categories: technology for students majoring in subjects other than engineering, 
the applied sciences, and the natural sciences; and topics common to students majoring 
in engineering, the applied sciences, and the natural sciences. Courses for nonscience 
majors are intended for all students seeking a broad perspective on issues of scientiﬁc 
and technological import, and they introduce students who may be planning careers 
in law, business, or public service to concepts and methods of engineering and 
applied science. Courses for science and engineering majors include topics in applied 
mathematics and computation.
