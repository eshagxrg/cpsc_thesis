Physics
Director of undergraduate studies: David Poland
(david.poland@yale.edu ); physics.yale.edu/academics/undergraduate-studies
The overarching goal of the physics program is to train students—majors and 
nonmajors alike—to think like physicists, the hallmarks of which include: striving 
for fundamental explanations that have broad predictive power; appreciating that 
quantitative analysis is necessary for proper understanding; simplifying physical 
situations to their essentials to enable the development of mathematical models to 
explain and predict experimental data; and comparing experimental data from the 
natural world to theory.
To achieve this goal, we oﬀer courses for physics majors who intend to further their 
study of physics or any STEM ﬁeld in graduate school, as well as those physics majors 
who intend to go into law, consulting, ﬁnancial services, technology industries, 
teaching, or any number of ﬁelds. Many students enroll in our introductory courses 
as a compulsory requirement of their STEM major; to satisfy a requirement for 
admission into medical school; or because they appreciate the quantitative training 
and intrinsic value oﬀered by a basic understanding of modern physics. The director of 
unde
rgraduate studies (DUS) can help students prepare for graduate school in physics 
by recommending appropriate electives to supplement the core courses. Research 
experience (PHYS 2710, 2720, 4710, and 4720) is an important aspect of preparing for 
graduate school.
The department oﬀers two majors in Physics: the B.S. and the B.S. intensive major. 
Students in either program acquire advanced training in physics, mathematics, and 
related topics through the core courses. They use electives to design individualized 
programs with more depth or breadth, depending on their interests. Both degree 
programs require some research experience. PHYS 2710 and PHYS 2720, introductory 
research courses, are open to all students. Juniors and seniors, as part of the senior 
requirement, are required to enroll in PHYS 4710 and 4720—one term for the B.S. 
degree and two terms for the B.S. degree, intensive major. Combined majors are 
available in Mathematics and Physics, Astrophysics, Physics and Philosophy, and 
Physics and Geosciences.
COURSES For NONMAJORS AND MAJORS
A guide to selecting physics courses is available to aid in course selection. Questions 
about placement should be addressed to the DUS.
Introductory courses with no calculus requirement Physics courses numbered 1200 
or below are for students with little or no previous experience in physics who do not 
plan to major in the natural sciences. Many of these courses fulﬁll the science and/or 
quantitative reasoning distributional requirements. These courses have no college-level 
mathematics requirement and do not satisfy the medical school requirement.
Introductory calculus-based lecture sequences
1.PHYS 1700 , 1710 is aimed at students who are interested in the biological
sciences or medicine. Knowledge of diﬀerential and integral calculus at the
level of MATH 1120  or equivalent is a prerequisite. MATH 1150  or (preferably)Physics         409
MATH 1160  should be taken concurrently with PHYS 1710 . PHYS 1700  is a 
prerequisite for PHYS 1710 .
2.PHYS 1800 , 1810 is aimed at students who plan to major in the physical sciences
or engineering. Calculus at the level of MATH 1120  is a prerequisite; MATH 1150
and MATH 1200  should be taken concurrently. PHYS 1800 or PHYS 2000  is a
prerequisite for PHYS 1810.
3.PHYS 2000 , 2010 is aimed at students with a strong background in mathematics
and physics who plan to major in the physical sciences. Calculus at the level of
MATH 1150  is presumed; MATH 1200 and either MATH 2220, MATH 2250, or
MATH 2260 , which are generally taken concurrently.
4.PHYS 2600 , 2610 is intended for students who have had excellent prior training in
mathematics and a solid foundation in physics. One of MATH 1200, ENAS 1510,
PHYS 4000, or the equivalent should be taken concurrently with PHYS 2600, 2610.
Students considering an alternative MATH course should check with the DUS in
Physics.
Introductory laboratories  Two diﬀerent introductory laboratory sequences are oﬀered:
PHYS 1650L , 1660L, and PHYS 2050L, 2060L. Each of these laboratory courses earns 
one-half course credit. Students normally take the laboratory courses associated with 
the introductory physics sequence in which they are enrolled.
1.PHYS 1650L , 1660L is an introductory laboratory sequence aimed at students
interested in engineering, the life sciences, and medicine. Related lecture courses are
PHYS 1700 , 1710, and PHYS 1800 , 1810.
2.PHYS 2050L , 2060L is for students who plan to major in the physical sciences
or engineering. Related lecture courses are PHYS 1800 , 1810; PHYS 2000, 2010;
and PHYS 2600 , 2610. Students who take the lecture courses in their ﬁrst year are
advised to start this laboratory sequence with PHYS 2050L in the spring of their
ﬁrst year or in the fall of sophomore year.
Advanced electives  A series of 3400-level electives explores special topics of interest 
to both majors and nonmajors. The electives are open to any student in Yale College 
who has completed a year of introductory calculus-based physics (PHYS 1700, 1710; 
or PHYS 1800, 1810; or PHYS 2000, 2010; or PHYS 2600, 2610). Physics courses 
numbered 3000 or higher count as electives for the major.
Prerequisites
B.S. degree program The prerequisites include an introductory lecture course 
sequence with a mathematics sequence equivalent to, or more advanced than, the 
corequisite of the physics sequence. The following options are appropriate: PHYS 
1700, 1710 with MATH 1120, MATH 1150; or PHYS 1800, 1810 with MATH 1150, 
MATH 1200; or PHYS 2000, 2010 with MATH 1200 and either MATH 2220 or 
MATH 2250 or MATH 2260; or PHYS 2600, 2610 with MATH 1200, ENAS 1510, 
PHYS 4000, or equivalent. In addition, the laboratory course PHYS 2050L or the 
sequence PHYS 1650L, 1660L is required. Students who take these physics and 
mathematics courses starting in their ﬁrst year may satisfy the prerequisites by the 
middle of their sophomore year. Students who begin taking physics courses in their 
sophomore year may also complete either the 410            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
standard or the intensive major. Students are advised to take mathematics courses 
throughout their ﬁrst year at the appropriate level.
B.S. degree program, intensive major The prerequisites for the B.S. degree with an 
intensive major are the same as for the standard program.
Requirements of the Major
Students are held to the requirements that were in place when they declared their 
major. However, with approval from the DUS, the following requirements, updated for 
the academic year 2025–2026, may be fulﬁlled by students who declared the major in a 
prior term.
B.S. degree program  Eight and one-half course credits are required beyond the 
prerequisites, including the senior project. Students must take a mathematics course 
at the level of, or more advanced than, PHYS 4000. Three courses at the core of the 
major, PHYS 4010, 4020, and either PHYS 4390 or 4400, involve advanced study of 
fundamental topics common to all branches of physics. PHYS 4010 and 4020 pertain 
to advanced classical physics (mechanics, statistical physics and thermodynamics, and 
electromagnetism), while the third, PHYS 4390 or 4400 covers quantum mechanics. 
PHYS 4010 must be taken before PHYS 4020, 4390, or 4400.
Because experiment is at the heart of the discipline, the major requires at least one 
laboratory course (PHYS 2060L or equivalent) and at least one term of independent 
research (PHYS 4710, 4720 or equivalent). Three advanced elective courses are also 
required. Suitable advanced courses are numbered 3000 or higher, such as the advanced 
laboratory PHYS 4450L, and 4000-level courses in Physics. Students may also ﬁnd 
suitable advanced courses in other departments in the sciences, engineering, and 
mathematics. Courses taken to satisfy these requirements must be approved by the 
DUS. In order to pursue their individual interests in suﬃcient depth, many students 
choose to take more than the required number of advanced courses.
B.S. degree program, intensive major Ten and one-half course credits are required 
beyond the prerequisites, including the senior project. Students must take a 
mathematics course at the level of, or more advanced than, PHYS 4000. Five courses 
at the core of the major involve advanced study of fundamental topics common to 
all branches of physics. Three of the courses pertain to advanced classical physics: 
mechanics (PHYS 4100), statistical physics and thermodynamics (PHYS 4500), and 
electromagnetism (PHYS 4300). Two other courses incorporate quantum mechanics 
(PHYS 4390 or 4400 and PHYS 4410). Because the ideas build progressively:
PHYS 4100 must precede PHYS 4390 or 4400; PHYS 4300 and PHYS 4390 or
4400 must precede PHYS 4410, and PHYS 4390 or 4400 must also precede or (with 
instructor permission) be taken concurrently with PHYS 4500.
Because experiment is at the heart of the discipline, the intensive major requires two 
laboratory courses (PHYS 2060L and PHYS 4450L or equivalent) and at least two 
terms of independent research (PHYS 4710, 4720 or equivalent). One advanced elective 
course is required to complete the program. Suitable advanced courses are numbered 
3000 or higher, and include 4000-level courses in Physics. Students may also ﬁnd 
suitable advanced courses in other departments in the sciences, engineering, and 
mathematics. Courses taken to satisfy these requirements must be approved by the Physics         411
DUS. In order to pursue their individual interests in suﬃcient depth, many students 
choose to take more than the required number of advanced courses.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of either major, including prerequisites.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
B.S. degree program The senior requirement for the standard B.S. degree is fulﬁlled 
by receiving a passing grade on a one-term research project in PHYS 4710 or 4720 or 
equivalent. One enrollment of PHYS 4710 or 4720 taken at any time during junior or 
senior year counts as the senior requirement for the Physics major. Students should 
consult the DUS for further information.
B.S. degree program, intensive major The senior requirement for the intensive major 
is fulﬁlled by receiving a passing grade on a two-term research project (or two one-
term research projects) in PHYS 4710 or 4720. Two enrollments of PHYS 4710 or 4720
taken at any time during junior or senior year counts as the senior requirement for 
the intensive Physics major. Students may take either PHYS 4710 or 4720 two times 
or they can take each course one time. Students should consult the DUS for further 
information.
Advising
All Physics majors in the sophomore, junior, and senior classes must have their 
programs approved by the DUS. First-year students and undeclared sophomores who 
are interested in Physics or related majors are encouraged to meet with the DUS to 
discuss their questions and proposed programs.
For both the standard B.S. degree and the B.S. degree with an intensive major, students 
are advised to begin the program in their ﬁrst year to allow the greatest amount of 
ﬂexibility in course selection. It is possible, however, to complete either program in a 
total of six terms, as illustrated below.
