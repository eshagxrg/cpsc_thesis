Mathematics has many aspects: it is the language and tool of the sciences, a cultural 
phenomenon with a rich historical tradition, and a model of abstract reasoning. The 
course oﬀerings and the major in Mathematics reﬂect these multiple facets. The 
Mathematics major provides a broad education in various areas of mathematics in a 
program ﬂexible enough to accommodate many ranges of interest. Incoming students 
are encouraged to visit the Math ﬁrst-year student resources website for advice about 
choosing their mathematics courses.
Prerequisite
The prerequisite for both the B.A and B.S. degree programs is single variable calculus, 
through the level of MATH 1150  or equivalent (such as a score of 4 or 5 on the AP 
Calculus BC exam).
CALCULUS Placement Procedures
The department oﬀers a three-term sequence in calculus, MATH 1120 , 1150, and 1200. 
Students who have not taken calculus at Yale and wish to enroll in calculus must take 
the mathematics online placement examination. Detailed information is available on the
Math ﬁrst-year student resources website. A calculus advising session will be held prior 
to registration to answer student questions about placement.
MATH 1120  covers diﬀerential calculus and assumes mastery of high school algebra, 
geometry, and trigonometry. Enrolling students are expected to know the basic 
deﬁnitions of trigonometric functions, inverse functions, factoring quadratic 
polynomials, and elementary area and volume formulas of plane and solid geometry. 
Students who could beneﬁt from a review of precalculus are encouraged to consider
MATH 1100  and 1110 in place of MATH 1120 .
The next course in the calculus sequence is MATH 1150 , which covers integral calculus, 
including sequences and series. It assumes mastery of the content of MATH 1120  or 
equivalent (AP Calculus AB exam).
MATH 1200  covers multivariable calculus and assumes mastery of the material in
MATH 1150  or equivalent (AP Calculus BC exam).
Requirements of the Major
See Links to the attributes indicating courses approved for Math major requirements.
Students are held to the requirements that were in place when they declared their 
major./uni2002However, with approval from the director of undergraduate studies (DUS), the 
following requirements, updated for the academic year 2024-2025, may be fulﬁlled by 
students who declared the major in a prior term.Mathematics         357
Introductory sequence requirement/uni2002Each student is expected to complete Linear 
algebra with proofs (MATH 2250 or 2260), Real analysis (MATH 2550 or 2560), and 
Vector analysis or Multivariable calculus (MATH 3020 or 1200).
B.A. degree program The B.A. degree program consists of ten term courses in 
M
athematics numbered 2250 or higher, including the senior requirement, but 
excluding MATH 4700. To acquire both depth and breadth in the ﬁeld, students are 
required to take at least three courses that carry the "math distribution" attribute 
(YC MATH Distribution), searchable in Yale Course Search (YCS). Students are 
also required to complete MATH 3500 (algebra), and at least one of MATH 3050
(real analysis) or MATH 3100 (complex analysis). Taking all three is recommended. 
With prior written permission from the DUS, students familiar with the material may 
substitute a higher-level course in the same area (typically MATH 3700, 3200, 3150 
respectively.)
B.S. degree program The B.S. degree program consists of twelve term courses and 
follows the same requirements as for the B.A. degree, with the addition of at least 
two advanced term courses in the physical sciences, such as ASTR 4180, ASTR 4300, 
CHEM 3330, 4700, PHYS 4010 or PHYS 4100, PHYS 4020 or PHYS 4300, PHYS 4400, 
PHYS 4410, PHYS 4500. Other such courses require the approval of the director of 
undergraduate studies (DUS); written approval is advised.
Distinction in the major To be eligible for Distinction in the Major, a student must 
have completed MATH 3050 (real analysis), MATH 3100 (complex analysis), and  
MATH 3500 (algebra).
The intensive major
 Candidates for a degree with an intensive major in Mathematics 
must take MATH 3050, 3100, and 3500. I
ntensive majors are also expected to include 
at least two graduate courses level 5000 or above in the Mathematics department, 
or equivalent independent study, among their required ten mathematics courses. 
Familiarity with the material of the following courses is prerequisite to graduate 
courses in each category: algebra: MATH 3500 and MATH 3700; analysis: MATH 3050, 
3100; algebraic topology: MATH 3500, 4300.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of the major.
Outside credit/uni2002 Courses taken after matriculation at Yale at another institution or 
during an approved summer or term-time study abroad program may count toward the 
major requirements with DUS approval.
Senior Requirement
During the senior year, students majoring in Mathematics fulﬁll the senior requirement 
by taking any Math course numbered MATH 4800 through MATH 4890. Alternatively, 
with the consent of the DUS, students may write a senior essay in MATH 4750 under 
the guidance of a faculty member, which includes both a written and an oral report. 
Students wishing to write a senior essay should consult the DUS at least six weeks 
before enrolling in MATH 4750, and are encouraged to pursue independent study 
opportunities prior to their senior year, for example through the Mathematics directed 
reading program or through summer research programs.358            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
Advising
Students interested in pursuing further study in pure mathematics should 
include MATH 3020, 3050, 3100, 3500, 3700, and 4300 in their programs, and should 
consider taking one or more graduate-level courses. Students interested in applications 
of mathematics should include MATH 3020, 3100, 3500, and a selection of courses from  
MATH 2410, 2420, 2440, 2460, 2470, 2510, 2600.
Courses related to mathematics/uni2002 Each Mathematics major is urged to acquire 
additional familiarity with the uses of mathematics by taking courses in Applied 
M
athematics, Computer Science, Engineering and Applied Science , Economics, 
P
hilosophy, Physics, Statistics and Data Science, or other departments. With approval 
from the DUS
, up to two math-intensive courses from other departments may be 
counted among the ten courses required for the major in Mathematics.
Graduate work/uni2002Each year the Mathematics department oﬀers a large number of 
graduate courses, some of which are accessible to undergraduates with advanced 
preparation in mathematics. Graduate courses numbered 5000–5999 may be counted 
tow
ard the requirements of the major.
Combined B.S./M.S. degree program/uni2002Students who, by the end of their senior year, 
complete the requirements of the department for the M.S. in Mathematics are eligible 
to receive this degree at their Senior Commencement. Required are: (1) eight additional 
term courses numbered 5000–9999, most of which must be completed with grades of B 
or better; (2) passing a written qualifying examination of the student ’
s choice from 
analysis, algebra, or topology.
The master's program is in no sense a substitute for the B.S. program; rather, it 
is designed to accommodate exceptional students who, by means of accelerated or 
independent study, can satisfy the department as to their command of the content of 
the normal undergraduate program by the end of the junior year. Candidates must 
contact the Mathematics DUS at least two weeks prior to the last day of classes of 
their ﬁfth term at Yale College. Minimum eligibility criteria include at least seventy-
ﬁve percent of A/A– grades within mathematics as well as seventy-ﬁve percent of A/
A– grades overall. For more information on mathematics requirements, please see 
the B.S./M.S. section of the Math major FAQ. For more information on Yale College 
requirements for the program, see Academic Regulations, Section L, Special Academic 
Arrangements, “Simultaneous Award of the Bachelor
’s and Master’s Degrees.”
Graduate classes: Undergraduate students are welcome to enroll in courses level 
5000 and above, after completing the relevant pre-requisites. We recommend that 
students wishing to take graduate classes begin with courses level 5000 –5999, which 
are designed to be accessible to advanced undergraduates, and can be counted toward 
undergraduate requirements of the major. Courses level 6000 and above cannot be 
counted toward undergraduate requirements of the major, but they can earn graduation 
credit, and be applied toward the graduate requirement of the intensive mathematics 
major as well as toward the graduate requirement of the combined B.S./M.S. degree.
