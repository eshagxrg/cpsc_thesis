Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
Director of undergraduate studies: Thomas Near (thomas.near@yale.edu);
eeb.yale.edu
The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) oﬀers broad education 
in the biological sciences, covering subject matter that ranges from molecules, cells, 
and organs through organisms to communities and ecosystems, and the evolutionary 
processes that shape them. The department oﬀers a B.S. and a B.A. degree. The B.S. 
program is designed for students planning to pursue graduate study in ecology and 
evolutionary biology, other biological disciplines, environmental science, or to attend 
medical, dental, or veterinary school. The B.A. program is intended for students 
who are interested in ecology, evolution, and organismal diversity as part of a liberal 
education but do not intend to pursue graduate work in the discipline, or for students 
who are interested in a second major. The two programs share the same prerequisites, 
introductory courses, and core requirements but diﬀer in their electives and senior 
requirements.
Courses for Nonmajors
Several EEB courses have no college-level prerequisites and are suitable for nonmajors. 
These include all 1000-level oﬀerings as well as 2000-level courses that deal with 
particular organism groups such as plants, ﬁsh, mammals, birds, and insects or other 
invertebrates.
Concentrations
Students majoring in EEB select one of two concentrations. The concentration 
in Biodiversity and the Environment emphasizes courses appropriate for careers 
in ecology, evolutionary biology, and environmental science. The concentration 
in Organismal Biology is appropriate for premedical, predental, and preveterinary 
students, and for students interested in research in physiology, functional morphology, 
and anatomy. The EEB major oﬀers opportunities for independent research in both 
laboratory and ﬁeld.
Prerequisites
The prerequisites for the major are intended to provide core scientiﬁc literacy; they 
include courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. Finishing these 
introductory courses early allows for a more ﬂexible program in later years, but it is not 
necessary to complete them before declaring the major.
The introductory biology sequence BIOL 1010 -1040 is required. Also required are a 
two-term lecture sequence in general chemistry, CHEM 1610 , 1650, or CHEM 1630 ,
1670, with associated laboratories, CHEM 1340L  and 1360L; one term of mathematics 
(MATH 1150  or 1160 or 1200) or one term of statistics & data science (S&DS 1000  or
2300).
Students should take four additional courses, for a total of four credits, from among 
the following options: MATH 1150  or 1160, MATH 1180  or 1200, MATH 2220  or
2250, MATH 2350 , 2410, 2420, 2440, 2460, 2470, 2550, S&DS 1000 , 2200, 2300,
2380, 2400, CPSC 1001 , 1230, 2010, CHEM 1740  or 2200, CHEM 1750  or 2210,
CHEM 2220L , 2230L, PHYS 1700 or 1800, PHYS 1710 or 1810, EPS 1100, 2120, 2200,252            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
2220, 2320, 2400, and 2550. No more than two of these four additional courses may 
originate in the same department.
An online program, ONEXYS for Physics, will be oﬀered in the summer by the 
Mathematics and Physics departments and by the Poorvu Center for Teaching and 
Learning, to review math skills needed in preparation for introductory physics courses.
Acceleration credit awarded in chemistry, mathematics, and physics, or completion of 
advanced courses in those departments, may be accepted in place of the corresponding 
introductory courses for the EEB major. Students who have mathematics preparation 
equivalent to MATH 1150  or higher are encouraged to take a statistics course and/or 
additional mathematics or statistics courses such as MATH 1200 , 1210, MATH 2220  or
2250 or 2260, and S&DS 2200  or 2300. Students are strongly urged to take general 
chemistry in the ﬁrst or second year. Students who place out of general chemistry can 
take organic chemistry during their ﬁrst year.
Placement Procedures
Students can place out of the introductory biology sequence (BIOL 1010 , 1020, 1030,
1040) by means of the biology placement examination administered jointly by the 
biological science departments, EEB, MB&B, and MCDB, at the beginning of the ﬁrst 
year.
Potential EEB majors are expected to take the mathematics placement test. Those who 
place above the level of MATH 1120  may proceed to introductory courses for the EEB 
major; those who place into MATH 1120  must take that course ﬁrst.
For information about placement examinations, refer to the Calendar for the Opening 
Days of College  and the Yale College Dean's Oﬃce website. The Chemistry department 
arranges placement in chemistry courses.
Requirements of the Major
See Links to the attributes indicating courses approved for the Ecology and 
Evolutionary Biology major requirements.
B.S. degree program Beyond the prerequisites, the B.S. degree requires three 
lecture courses and one laboratory, for three and one-half course credits; two 
electives for two course credits, one of which must be a lecture or a seminar; 
and the senior requirement. The required courses in the Biodiversity and the 
Environment concentration are EEB 2220, 2225, and a lecture course on organismal 
diversity usually chosen from EEB 2246–2272, along with its associated laboratory, 
or EEB 3326 and EEB 3327L . Other lecture courses on organismal diversity, with 
laboratory, are permitted with approval of the DUS, including MCDB 2900  and 2910L. 
Required courses in the Organismal Biology concentration include EEB 2290; EEB 2295
or BENG 3200 ; MCDB 3000  or MB&B 3000 ; and EEB 2291L . Most EEB, MCDB, or 
MB&B courses numbered 200 or above qualify as electives, as do most research courses 
and laboratories in a biological sciences department or in the Yale School of Medicine. 
Courses from other science departments as well as Mathematics, Statistics and Data 
Science, and Computer Science may qualify with permission of the DUS. Residential 
College Seminars may not be counted toward the requirements of the major.Ecology and Evolutionary Biology         253
B.A. degree program Beyond the prerequisites, the B.A. degree requires the same 
courses as the B.S. degree, except for the two electives for a total of three and one-half 
course credits (not counting the senior requirement).
Limit on research courses While independent research courses may be taken 
multiple times for credit, there are restrictions on the number of such courses 
that can be included in a student's curriculum. See Academic Regulations, section 
C, Course Credits and Course Loads. Interested sophomores and juniors can 
take EEB 4469  and EEB 4474. For information on how to become involved in research, 
see the EEB Guide to Research and Undergraduate Research Opportunities. For 
information on fellowships and summer experiences, see the EEB Guide to Fellowships 
and Summer Experiences.
Limit on courses taken in the professional schools Undergraduates may apply up to 4 
courses taken in the professional schools for credit towards graduation. See Academic 
Regulations, section L, Special Academic Arrangements for more information.
Graduate courses of interest to undergraduates Graduate courses in the biological and 
biomedical sciences that may be of interest to undergraduates are listed in the Graduate 
School online bulletin, and many are posted on the Biological and Biomedical Sciences 
website. There is no limit on the number of courses students may take in the Graduate 
School of Arts and Sciences. Additional information is available from the DUS and the 
director of graduate studies. Undergraduates with an appropriate background may 
enroll with the permission of the director of graduate studies and the instructor.
Credit/D/Fail No course, including prerequisites, taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied 
toward the requirements of the major.
Outside credit Courses taken at another institution or during an approved summer or 
term-time study abroad program may count toward the major requirements with DUS 
approval.
Senior Requirement
B.S. degree program Students in the B.S. degree program fulﬁll the senior requirement 
by completing two terms of original research in EEB 4475 and EEB 4476, or 
in EEB 4495 and EEB 4496 . Students interested in conducting research before their 
senior year may do so by taking EEB 4469  or EEB 4474, but they do not count toward 
the senior requirement.
B.A. degree program Students in the B.A. degree program fulﬁll the senior requirement 
either by completing one term of independent study in EEB 4470 or by writing a senior 
essay. The senior essay may be related to the subject matter of a course, but the senior 
essay is a separate departmental requirement in addition to any work done in a course 
and does not count toward the grade in any course. Students intending to write a senior 
essay must obtain an approval form from the oﬃce of the DUS and have it signed by 
the senior essay adviser before the end of the course selection period. Senior essays 
must be submitted to the DUS by the last day of classes.
Advising
First-year students considering a major in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology are invited 
to consult with the DUS. After the ﬁrst year, students should choose an adviser from 
the department faculty who has interests comparable to their own and/or is a fellow of 254            Yale College Programs of Study 2025–2026
their residential college. For additional information, visit the EEB website. Students in 
EEB should consult one of the advisers assigned to their class (see below). The course 
schedules of all EEB majors (including sophomores intending to major in EEB) must 
be reviewed by a faculty member in EEB; the signature of the DUS is not required, but 
is valid for any student. Students whose regular adviser is on leave can consult the DUS 
to arrange for an alternate.
Peer Mentors
Peer mentors provide a helpful student perspective to navigating the major and the 
department. Students are encouraged to contact them.
YEEBUG is an undergraduate group of Yale's Ecology and Evolutionary Biology 
majors. The student members organize social events and panels, lead ﬁeld trips, and 
represent the group at bazaars and academic fairs.
Study Abroad
Participation in study abroad  ﬁeld programs is encouraged. The Organization for 
Tropical Studies ( OTS) and the School for Field Studies (SFS) provide speciﬁc 
opportunities for study of tropical and conservation biology. Credit for such programs 
may apply toward the major; interested students should consult the DUS prior to going 
abroad.
