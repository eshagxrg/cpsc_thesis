Economics and Mathematics
Directors of undergraduate studies: Giovanni Maggi

DUS  (math.dus@yale.edu)
The Economics and Mathematics major is intended for students with a strong interest 
in both mathematics and economics, and for students who may pursue a graduate 
degree in economics.
Prerequisites 
The major has prerequisites in both mathematics and economics: MATH 1200 ;
ECON 1110 or 1115; and ECON 1111 or 1116. Upper level economics courses may be 
substituted for prerequisite economics courses. With prior written permission from the 
Mathematics DUS, students who completed multivariable calculus during high school 
may substitute a higher level mathematics course in the same area. Upper-level courses 
substituted for prerequisites do not count toward the total of twelve term courses 
(beyond the introductory level in economics and mathematics) required for the major.
Requirements of the Major
See Links to the attribute indicating courses approved for Economic theory 
seminar requirements.
A total of twelve term courses is required beyond the introductory level in economics 
and in mathematics: seven term courses in economics numbered above 2120, and ﬁve 
term courses in mathematics numbered above 2250 (except MATH 4700 , MATH 2410
and MATH 2420  - see below). These courses must include:
1.One intermediate microeconomics course (ECON 2125 is preferred, 
but ECON 2121 is also acceptable) and one intermediate macroeconomics course 
(ECON 2126 is preferred, but ECON 2122 is also acceptable).
2.Two mathematical economics courses, ECON 3351 or 4425 and one of ECON 3350,
4417, or 4433.
3.Two courses in econometrics, ECON 2135 (or equivalent) and ECON 2136.
ECON 2135 can be replaced by S&DS 2410  and 2420, in which case they count as 
one economics course and not as mathematics courses. Neither S&DS 2410  nor 2420
can be counted toward the major in parallel to ECON 2135. 
4.One proof-based linear algebra course (MATH 2250  or 2260) and one real analysis 
course (MATH 2550  or 2560). 
5.A senior seminar as described in the "Senior requirement" section 
below. MATH 4800  or 4810 counts toward the required mathematics courses; an 
Economic theory seminar counts toward the required economics courses. 
A course must be listed with a MATH number to count toward the mathematics 
requirements—substitutions from other departments are not permitted. Graduate 
mathematics courses level 5000-5999 may be counted as electives; graduate 
mathematics courses level 6000 or above may not be counted.Economics and Mathematics         263
Distinction in the Major To be considered for Distinction in the Major, students must 
mee
t minimum grade standards, as speciﬁed under "Honors" in The Undergraduate 
Curriculum, and submit a senior essay in Economics that earns a grade of A or A–. For 
details on the senior essay in Economics see Economics. All courses beyond the 
introductory level in Mathematics and Economics are counted in the computation of 
grades for Distinction.
Credit/D/Fail/uni2002No course taken Credit/D/Fail may be applied toward the requirements 
of the major, including the prerequisites.
Outside credit/uni2002 Courses taken after matriculation at Yale at another institution or 
during an approved summer or term-time study abroad program may count toward the 
major requirements with DUS approval.
Senior Requirement
Students must take either a senior seminar in mathematics, MATH 4800 or 4810, or 
an Economic theory seminar, designated as YC ECON Theory Seminar in Yale Course 
Search. A senior essay in Economics is optional.
Advising 
Students interested in the major should consult both DUSs, and verify with each that 
their proposed program meets the relevant guidelines.
